1,"Figure 1. We train a Navigation World Model (NWM) from video footage of robots and their associated navigation actions (a). After training, NWM can evaluate trajectories by synthesizing their videos and scoring the ﬁnal frame’s similarity with the goal (b). We use NWM to plan from scratch or rank experts navigation trajectories, improving downstream visual navigation performance. In unknown environments, NWM can simulate imagined trajectories from a single image (c). In all examples above, the input to the model is the ﬁrst image and actions, then the model auto-regressively synthesizes future observations. Click on the image to view examples in a browser."

To navigate from the observation image to the goal, we sample trajectories from NoMaD [55], simulate each of these trajectories using NWM, score them (see Equation 4), and rank them.

As shown in Figure 4, AlSb exhibits a phase transition near 245-250 K. Lower values  of the Helmholtz free energy correspond to a more stable configuration at a given temperature,  which is particularly important  when evaluating materials for high-temperature applications."
