I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a\\n\\nwizard.”\\n\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\\n\\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.\\n\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”\\n\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\n\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\n\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\\n\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely,', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 72] “Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\\n\\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.\\n\\nHarry nodded.\\n\\n“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said\\n\\nRon. “And have you really got — you know…”\\n\\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead.\\n\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n\\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who —?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”\\n\\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.\\n\\n“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”\\n\\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\\n\\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\\n\\n“Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”\\n\\n“So you must know loads of magic already.”\\n\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n\\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”\\n\\n“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 75] Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\n\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\n\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\nC onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\n\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n\\n“He’s gone!”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it? You can start collecting.”\\n\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\\n\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] setting fire to his bed.”\\n\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?”\\n\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\\n\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”\\n\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 110] “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about —”\\n\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”\\n\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.”\\n\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.”\\n\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”\\n\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?”', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 44] “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”\\n\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\n\\nangry?”\\n\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\n\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\\n\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be\\n\\nright famous at Hogwarts.”\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\\n\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”\\n\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”', '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 14] “Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\\n\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to\\n\\nhappen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 41] pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\n\\nDear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. Hagrid\\n\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\n\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n\\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n\\n“He’s not going,” he said.\\n\\nHagrid grunted.\\n\\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\\n\\n“A what?” said Harry, interested.\\n\\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”\\n\\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 188] “So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.”\\n\\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n\\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”\\n\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.\\n\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\n\\nJust in case.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 42] “But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.\\n\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\n\\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”\\n\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n\\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it.…”\\n\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...”\\n\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n\\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 44] Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\\n\\n“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”\\n\\n“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see…he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?\\n\\n“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.\\n\\n“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”\\n\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 212] He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\\n\\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\\n\\n“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\\n\\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”\\n\\n“Then who does? Sir, I —”\\n\\n“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”\\n\\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\\n\\n“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”\\n\\n“How long have I been in here?”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\n\\ncoming….”\\n\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”\\n\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”\\n\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but….', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 158] As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\n\\n“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”\\n\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n“I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”\\n\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited since they’d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\n\\n“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n\\n“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”\\n\\n“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\\n\\nAt last she found what she was looking for.', \"[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 117] It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\nHALLOWEEN\\n\\nM alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\", '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n\\n“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.\\n\\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”\\n\\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they\\n\\nfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”\\n\\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.\\n\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n\\n“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?” “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n\\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”\\n\\n“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”\\n\\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 186] Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\\n\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\\n\\nknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\\n\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t understand who —”\\n\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\\n\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\n\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 216] “Harry!”\\n\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so\\n\\nworried —”\\n\\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really\\n\\nhappened?”\\n\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n\\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to die?”\\n\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”\\n\\n“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n\\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.”', \"[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 155] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\n\\nNICHOLAS FLAMEL\\n\\nD umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\\n\\n“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\n\\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\n\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\"], [\"[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 65] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\n\\nH arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\\n\\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\\n\\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television.

Rowling\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER ONE\\n\\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\\n\\nM r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.\\n\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\n\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\", '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 20] Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”\\n\\n“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly…”\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.\\n\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.\\n\\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his', \"[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 24] closer look.\\n\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\nLETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\nT he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\", '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 24] He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\\n\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild- looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a', '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 19] “We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n\\n“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”\\n\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug.\\n\\n“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”\\n\\n“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.\\n\\n“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer).\\n\\nAunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.\\n\\n“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled.\\n\\n“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.\\n\\n“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “… and leave him in the car.…”\\n\\n“That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone.…”\\n\\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\\n\\n“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n\\n“I…don’t…want…him…t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] setting fire to his bed.”\\n\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?”\\n\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\\n\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”\\n\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”', '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 19] “Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.\\n\\n“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right\\n\\nthen.”\\n\\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\\n\\n“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair.\\n\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n\\n“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.\\n\\nDudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.\\n\\n“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.', '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 33] “I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\\n\\n“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.\\n\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\\n\\n“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.”\\n\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\\n\\ntelevision — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 90] Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\\n\\n“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest. “I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\n\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding…\\n\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. “I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”\\n\\nThe others laughed.\\n\\n“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.\\n\\n“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages.

I don’t think I can be a wizard.”\\n\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\n\\nangry?”\\n\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\n\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\\n\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be\\n\\nright famous at Hogwarts.”\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\\n\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”\\n\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”', '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 39] Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.\\n\\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”\\n\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”\\n\\n“What world?”\\n\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n\\n“DURSLEY!” he boomed.\\n\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\n\\n“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”\\n\\n“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”\\n\\n“Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\n\\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.\\n\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n\\n“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!”\\n\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\\n\\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore\\n\\nleft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley!

I can see —”\\n\\n“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”\\n\\nMrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\\n\\n“Busy year?” she said.\\n\\n“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.\\n\\nWeasley.”\\n\\n“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”\\n\\n“Ready, are you?”\\n\\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\\n\\n“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away.\\n\\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n“See you over the summer, then.”\\n\\n“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\\n\\n“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.…', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 150] How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.\\n\\n“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\\n\\n“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the mirror. “I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.\\n\\n“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.”\\n\\n“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating\\n\\nanything?”\\n\\nHarry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n\\n“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”\\n\\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.', '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 32] They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.\\n\\n“Shake ’em off…shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.\\n\\nHe’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\\n\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.…\\n\\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.\\n\\n“’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”\\n\\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\\n\\nMr. H. Potter\\n\\nRoom 17\\n\\nRailview Hotel\\n\\nCokeworth\\n\\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.', '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 26] “They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”\\n\\n“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said.\\n\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several\\n\\nyears.\\n\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was\\n\\nsupposed to be good training for later life.\\n\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.', \"[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 16] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO\\n\\nTHE VANISHING GLASS\\n\\nN early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\n\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.\\n\\n“Up! Get up! Now!”\\n\\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\n\\n“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.\", '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 31] “Dudley — go — just go.”\\n\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.\\n\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\n\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door —\\n\\n“AAAAARRRGH!”\\n\\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive!\\n\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 43] “Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot….”\\n\\n“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\\n\\n“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end —”\\n\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word….”\\n\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.\\n\\n“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 218] I’ve got loads.…”\\n\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”\\n\\n“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\\n\\n“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ‘course, he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this.…”\\n\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\\n\\n“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos… knew yeh didn’ have any…d’yeh like it?”\\n\\nHarry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\n\\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin’s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\\n\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.'], ['[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 50] himself.\\n\\n“’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.”\\n\\n“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”\\n\\n“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”\\n\\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\\n\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”\\n\\n“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”\\n\\n“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”\\n\\n“You’d like one?”\\n\\n“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 168] “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\\n\\nHagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\\n\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he borrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments… Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”\\n\\n“Snape?”\\n\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\\n\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 58] Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n\\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Play Quidditch at all?”\\n\\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n\\n“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\\n\\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n\\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\\n\\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\\n\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up', '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 40] “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.\\n\\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a\\n\\nwizard.”\\n\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\\n\\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.\\n\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”\\n\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\n\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\n\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\\n\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely,', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 49] got yeh.”\\n\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\\n\\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\\n\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\\n\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”\\n\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.\\n\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\\n\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 167] “But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them\\n\\nforget.”\\n\\n“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.\\n\\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\\n\\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\\n\\n“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.”\\n\\nHagrid frowned at him.\\n\\n“O’ course I can’t,“ he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 167] “Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”\\n\\n“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —”\\n\\n“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve told yeh —”\\n\\n“See you later, then,” said Harry.\\n\\nHagrid shuffled off.\\n\\n“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”\\n\\n“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who’d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.\\n\\n“Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.”\\n\\n“Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, “ said Harry.\\n\\n“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 102] Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”\\n\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\n\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\n\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\\n\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with animals.”\\n\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\\n\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 169] He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.\\n\\n“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\\n\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\\n\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\\n\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.\\n\\n“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?”\\n\\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what\\n\\nHagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”\\n\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered.\\n\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\\n\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 41] pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\n\\nDear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. Hagrid\\n\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\n\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n\\n“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n\\n“He’s not going,” he said.\\n\\nHagrid grunted.\\n\\n“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.\\n\\n“A what?” said Harry, interested.\\n\\n“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”\\n\\n“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 44] “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”\\n\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\n\\nangry?”\\n\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\n\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\\n\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be\\n\\nright famous at Hogwarts.”\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\\n\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”\\n\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself.

Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n\\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n\\n“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.\\n\\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”\\n\\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they\\n\\nfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”\\n\\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.\\n\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n\\n“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?” “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n\\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”\\n\\n“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”\\n\\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] setting fire to his bed.”\\n\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?”\\n\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\\n\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”\\n\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”', '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 39] Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.\\n\\n“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.”\\n\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”\\n\\n“What world?”\\n\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n\\n“DURSLEY!” he boomed.\\n\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\n\\n“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”\\n\\n“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”\\n\\n“Yeh don’ know...yeh don’ know....” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\n\\n“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.\\n\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n\\n“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!”\\n\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.\\n\\n“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore\\n\\nleft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?”', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!”\\n\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n\\n“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in —”\\n\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!”\\n\\n“So what is Quidditch?”\\n\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”\\n\\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n\\n“School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’\\n\\nduffers, but —”\\n\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”\\n\\n“Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 42] “But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.\\n\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\n\\n“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”\\n\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n\\n“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it.…”\\n\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...”\\n\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n\\n“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 53] But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\\n\\n“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\\n\\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\\n\\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\\n\\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\\n\\n“Is he always that nervous?”\\n\\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\\n\\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n\\n“Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.” He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 98] Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.\\n\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\\n\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”\\n\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\\n\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:'], ['[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 68] he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.\\n\\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\\n\\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.\\n\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 66] “Er — Uncle Vernon?”\\n\\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\n\\n“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.” Uncle Vernon grunted again.\\n\\n“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”\\n\\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n\\n“Thank you.”\\n\\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\\n\\n“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?”\\n\\nHarry didn’t say anything.\\n\\n“Where is this school, anyway?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n\\n“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.\\n\\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\\n\\n“Platform what?”\\n\\n“Nine and three-quarters.”\\n\\n“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”\\n\\n“It’s on my ticket.”\\n\\n“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”\\n\\n“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.\\n\\n“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 148] Use it well.\\n\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.\\n\\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the first time — he wanted to use it alone.\\n\\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.\\n\\n“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.\\n\\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\\n\\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.\\n\\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.', \"[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 65] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\n\\nH arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\\n\\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.\\n\\nOn the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\", '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 67] Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\\n\\nThey reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\\n\\n“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do\\n\\nthey?”\\n\\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.\\n\\n“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was', \"[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 117] It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\nHALLOWEEN\\n\\nM alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\", '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 31] “Dudley — go — just go.”\\n\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.\\n\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\n\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door —\\n\\n“AAAAARRRGH!”\\n\\nHarry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive!\\n\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 192] “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\\n\\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore\\n\\nbelieves us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?”\\n\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\\n\\n“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\\n\\n“What are you three doing inside?”\\n\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n\\n“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\\n\\n“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”\\n\\nHarry swallowed — now what?\\n\\n“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 210] me.…”\\n\\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\\n\\n“I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?” Harry’s mind was racing.\\n\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?\\n\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\n\\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\\n\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\\n\\n“Use the boy…Use the boy.…”\\n\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\\n\\n“Yes — Potter — come here.”\\n\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\\n\\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 173] “Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\\n\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\\n\\n“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —”\\n\\n“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got a\\n\\ndragon!”\\n\\n“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!”\\n\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\\n\\n“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”\\n\\n“Don’t,” Harry advised her.\\n\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 57] One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.\\n\\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did\\n\\nstill look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.\\n\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n\\n“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\\n\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n\\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n\\n“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own.

Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n\\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 63] The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington\\n\\nstation; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.\\n\\n“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.\\n\\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. “You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\\n\\n“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander…but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 64] Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.\\n\\n“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”\\n\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n\\n“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, “ he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me….See yeh soon, Harry.”\\n\\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 49] got yeh.”\\n\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\\n\\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\\n\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\\n\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”\\n\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.\\n\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\\n\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 110] “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about —”\\n\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”\\n\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.”\\n\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.”\\n\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week.

Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\nLETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\nT he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\", '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\n\\ncoming….”\\n\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”\\n\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”\\n\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but….', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 152] “You sound like Hermione.”\\n\\n“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”\\n\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him.\\n\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet\\n\\nanyone.\\n\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\\n\\nExcept —\\n\\n“So — back again, Harry?”\\n\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.\\n\\n“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”\\n\\n“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\n\\n“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror\\n\\nof Erised.”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n\\n“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.\\n\\n“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”\\n\\n“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n\\n“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they\\n\\nfound Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”\\n\\n“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.\\n\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n\\n“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?” “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n\\n“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”\\n\\n“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”\\n\\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.'], [\"[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 117] It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\nHALLOWEEN\\n\\nM alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\", '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 51] COURSE BOOKS\\n\\nAll students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble\\n\\nOTHER EQUIPMENT\\n\\n1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales\\n\\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad\\n\\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS\\n\\n“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.\\n\\n“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nHarry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\n\\n“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 57] One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.\\n\\n“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did\\n\\nstill look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.\\n\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n\\n“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\\n\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n\\n“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry.\\n\\n“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 145] “What is it?”\\n\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.\\n\\n“It’s an invisibility cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I’m sure it is — try it on.”\\n\\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\n\\n“It is! Look down!”\\n\\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\\n\\n“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”\\n\\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:\\n\\nYour father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A Very Merry Christmas to you.\\n\\nUse it well.\\n\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.\\n\\n“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s the\\n\\nmatter?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?\\n\\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 60] “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nThey bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n\\n“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”\\n\\n“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.”\\n\\nHagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 144] Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. “Don’t send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.”\\n\\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\\n\\n“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.\\n\\n“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents!”\\n\\n“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s.\\n\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.\\n\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\\n\\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 60] Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again.\\n\\n“Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday\\n\\npresent.”\\n\\nHarry felt himself go red.\\n\\n“You don’t have to —”\\n\\n“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad,', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 48] “Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”\\n\\n“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”\\n\\nHagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n\\n“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.\\n\\n“Knuts?”\\n\\n“The little bronze ones.”\\n\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so\\n\\nHarry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.\\n\\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n\\n“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”\\n\\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.\\n\\n“Um — Hagrid?”\\n\\n“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n\\n“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night…he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 63] Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…how curious…how very curious…”\\n\\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious…curious…\\n\\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n\\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\\n\\nHarry swallowed.\\n\\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember…I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter….After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.”\\n\\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 147] Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\\n\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge.\\n\\nIt had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\\n\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\\n\\nHis father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\\n\\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 75] Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\n\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\n\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\nC onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\n\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n\\n“He’s gone!”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it? You can start collecting.”\\n\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\\n\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 51] They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\n\\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\n\\n“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches.\\n\\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n\\n“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”\\n\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read:\\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 49] got yeh.”\\n\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.\\n\\n“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.\\n\\n“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.\\n\\n“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”\\n\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.\\n\\n“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.\\n\\n“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.”\\n\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 145] “That’s friendly,” said Harry.\\n\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n\\n“Weird!” he said, ‘What a shape! This is money?”\\n\\n“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?”\\n\\n“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.”\\n\\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\n\\n“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own, “and mine’s always maroon.”\\n\\n“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very\\n\\ntasty.\\n\\nHis next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.\\n\\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.\\n\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\n\\n“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\n\\ncoming….”\\n\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”\\n\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”\\n\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but….', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 56] “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”\\n\\n“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”\\n\\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.\\n\\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n\\n“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.\\n\\nAll Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known\\n\\nabout this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\n\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n\\n“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 61] “Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\\n\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\\n\\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\\n\\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n\\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n\\n“And that’s where…”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.\\n\\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen- and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands…well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 208] Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\\n\\n“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.”\\n\\n“You let the troll in?”\\n\\n“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else\\n\\nwas running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off properly.\\n\\n“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\\n\\n“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”\\n\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\\n\\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 62] Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n\\n“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.”\\n\\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n\\n“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”\\n\\nHarry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\\n\\nsnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n\\n“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”\\n\\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\\n\\n“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”'], ['[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 87] “Bones, Susan!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\\n\\n“Boot, Terry!”\\n\\n“RAVENCLAW!”\\n\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.\\n\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.\\n\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they\\n\\nliked him.\\n\\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\n\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n\\n“Granger, Hermione!”\\n\\nHer mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 85] Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:\\n\\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There’s nothing hidden in your head\\n\\nThe Sorting Hat can’t see,\\n\\nSo try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don’t be afraid! And don’t get in a flap! You’re in safe hands (though I have none)', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 83] “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.”\\n\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten\\n\\nhis hair.\\n\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”\\n\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n\\n“How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.\\n\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\\n\\njoking.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 161] George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”\\n\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”\\n\\n“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something.”\\n\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\\n\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—”\\n\\n“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —”\\n\\n“What? Where?”\\n\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 87] head.\\n\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\n\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?\\n\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”\\n\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”\\n\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\\n\\nThere weren’t many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…, “Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks, Sally-Anne”…, and then, at last —\\n\\n“Potter, Harry!”\\n\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\\n\\n“Potter, did she say?”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 88] He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,\\n\\ntoo, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\\n\\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\\n\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\n\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 88] “The Harry Potter?”\\n\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting….So where shall I put you?”\\n\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\\n\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!”\\n\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n\\n“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in —”\\n\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!”\\n\\n“So what is Quidditch?”\\n\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”\\n\\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n\\n“School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’\\n\\nduffers, but —”\\n\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”\\n\\n“Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 77] “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\\n\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”\\n\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I\\n\\nhear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”\\n\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n\\n“Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”\\n\\n“What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\\n\\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 58] Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n\\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Play Quidditch at all?”\\n\\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n\\n“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\\n\\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n\\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\\n\\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\\n\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 219] “…for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\n\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess set!”\\n\\nAt last there was silence again.\\n\\n“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger…for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\n\\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves — they were a hundred points up.\\n\\n“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. “…for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.”\\n\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\n\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n\\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 98] Dear Harry,\\n\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\\n\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with\\n\\nHedwig. Hagrid\\n\\nHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so\\n\\nfar.\\n\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.\\n\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.\\n\\n“Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”\\n\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 134] colors.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\\n\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\n\\n“Okay, men,” he said.\\n\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”\\n\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.\\n\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.\\n\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the team last year.”\\n\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.”\\n\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”\\n\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”\\n\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\n\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.', '[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 40] “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.\\n\\n“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n\\n“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a\\n\\nwizard.”\\n\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.\\n\\n“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.\\n\\n“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”\\n\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\n\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\n\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\n\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.\\n\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely,', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 218] Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\\n\\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were…you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.…\\n\\n“Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”\\n\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\\n\\nsight.\\n\\n“Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken into account.”\\n\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.\\n\\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes…\\n\\n“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”\\n\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 86] For I’m a Thinking Cap!”\\n\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n\\n“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”\\n\\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\\n\\n“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”\\n\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause —\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.\\n\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. “Bones, Susan!”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 98] Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.\\n\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\\n\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”\\n\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\\n\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 75] Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\n\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\n\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\nC onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\n\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n\\n“He’s gone!”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it? You can start collecting.”\\n\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\\n\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 219] Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\\n\\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.”\\n\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\\n\\nGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\\n\\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget tonight.', \"[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 24] closer look.\\n\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\nLETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\nT he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\"], ['[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 219] “…for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\n\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.

I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 87] “Bones, Susan!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\\n\\n“Boot, Terry!”\\n\\n“RAVENCLAW!”\\n\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n\\n“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.\\n\\n“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.\\n\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they\\n\\nliked him.\\n\\n“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”\\n\\n“HUFFLEPUFF!”\\n\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n\\n“Granger, Hermione!”\\n\\nHer mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 85] Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:\\n\\n“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There’s nothing hidden in your head\\n\\nThe Sorting Hat can’t see,\\n\\nSo try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don’t be afraid! And don’t get in a flap! You’re in safe hands (though I have none)', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 88] “The Harry Potter?”\\n\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n\\n“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting….So where shall I put you?”\\n\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\\n\\n“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 83] “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.”\\n\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten\\n\\nhis hair.\\n\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”\\n\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n\\n“How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.\\n\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\\n\\njoking.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 88] He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,\\n\\ntoo, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\\n\\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”\\n\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\\n\\n“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\n\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 161] George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”\\n\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”\\n\\n“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something.”\\n\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\\n\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—”\\n\\n“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —”\\n\\n“What? Where?”\\n\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.', \"[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 82] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN\\n\\nTHE SORTING HAT\\n\\nT he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\\n\\n“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”\\n\\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\\n\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\\n\\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\", '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 87] head.\\n\\n“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\n\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?\\n\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”\\n\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”\\n\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\\n\\nThere weren’t many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…, “Parkinson”…, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks, Sally-Anne”…, and then, at last —\\n\\n“Potter, Harry!”\\n\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\\n\\n“Potter, did she say?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 77] “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\\n\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”\\n\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I\\n\\nhear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”\\n\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n\\n“Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”\\n\\n“What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\\n\\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 134] colors.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\\n\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\n\\n“Okay, men,” he said.\\n\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”\\n\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.\\n\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.\\n\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the team last year.”\\n\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.”\\n\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”\\n\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”\\n\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\n\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 58] Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n\\n“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.\\n\\n“No,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Play Quidditch at all?”\\n\\n“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\n\\n“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”\\n\\n“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n\\n“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\\n\\n“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.\\n\\n“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”\\n\\n“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.\\n\\n“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 98] Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start.\\n\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\n\\n“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\\n\\n“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.”\\n\\n“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\\n\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n\\nHedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 218] Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\\n\\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were…you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.…\\n\\n“Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”\\n\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\\n\\nsight.\\n\\n“Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken into account.”\\n\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.\\n\\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes…\\n\\n“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”\\n\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 110] “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.”\\n\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. “Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\\n\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall\\n\\nexplained.\\n\\n“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\\n\\n“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first- year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.…” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.”\\n\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\n\\n“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”\\n\\n“You’re joking.”\\n\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.', \"[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 24] closer look.\\n\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\nLETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\nT he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\", '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 219] Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\\n\\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.”\\n\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\\n\\nGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\\n\\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget tonight.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!”\\n\\n“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.\\n\\n“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in —”\\n\\n“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!”\\n\\n“So what is Quidditch?”\\n\\n“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.”\\n\\n“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”\\n\\n“School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’\\n\\nduffers, but —”\\n\\n“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.\\n\\n“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”\\n\\n“Vol-, sorry —You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 123] “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\n\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because\\n\\nNeville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 98] Dear Harry,\\n\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\\n\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with\\n\\nHedwig. Hagrid\\n\\nHarry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so\\n\\nfar.\\n\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.\\n\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\n\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.\\n\\n“Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”\\n\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.'], ['[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.”\\n\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 72] “Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.\\n\\n“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.\\n\\nHarry nodded.\\n\\n“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said\\n\\nRon. “And have you really got — you know…”\\n\\nHe pointed at Harry’s forehead.\\n\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n\\n“So that’s where You-Know-Who —?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”\\n\\n“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.\\n\\n“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”\\n\\n“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.\\n\\n“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.\\n\\n“Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”\\n\\n“So you must know loads of magic already.”\\n\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n\\n“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”\\n\\n“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 78] “What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\\n\\n“Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed.\\n\\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger\\n\\nthis time.\\n\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n\\n“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\\n\\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\\n\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 216] “Harry!”\\n\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so\\n\\nworried —”\\n\\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really\\n\\nhappened?”\\n\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n\\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to die?”\\n\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”\\n\\n“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n\\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.”', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 110] “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about —”\\n\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”\\n\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.”\\n\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.”\\n\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”\\n\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 77] “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.\\n\\n“Harry Potter,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”\\n\\n“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n\\n“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I\\n\\nhear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad....Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”\\n\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n\\n“Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”\\n\\n“What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\\n\\n“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 72] “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”\\n\\n“We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.”\\n\\n“George!”\\n\\n“Only joking, Mom.”\\n\\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\n\\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.\\n\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.\\n\\n“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”\\n\\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\\n\\n“Hey, Ron.”\\n\\nThe twins were back.\\n\\n“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”\\n\\n“Right,” mumbled Ron.\\n\\n“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 144] Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\\n\\n“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”\\n\\n“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”\\n\\n“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.\\n\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.\\n\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.', \"[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 117] It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\nHALLOWEEN\\n\\nM alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\", '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 129] “Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”\\n\\n“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.”\\n\\n“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.\\n\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n\\n“Pig snout,” they said and entered.\\n\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.\\n\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 157] Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\n\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\n\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 168] “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\\n\\nHagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\\n\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he borrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments… Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”\\n\\n“Snape?”\\n\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\\n\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 123] “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\n\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because\\n\\nNeville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 102] Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”\\n\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\n\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\n\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\\n\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with animals.”\\n\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\\n\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] setting fire to his bed.”\\n\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?”\\n\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\\n\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”\\n\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 161] George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”\\n\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”\\n\\n“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something.”\\n\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\\n\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—”\\n\\n“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —”\\n\\n“What? Where?”\\n\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 159] “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 142] “Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn’t more. Move along, all of you.”\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.\\n\\n“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one of these days, I’ll get him —”\\n\\n“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”\\n\\n“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”\\n\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.\\n\\n“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?”\\n\\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.\\n\\n“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.\\n\\n“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 169] He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.\\n\\n“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\\n\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\\n\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\\n\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.\\n\\n“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?”\\n\\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what\\n\\nHagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”\\n\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered.\\n\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\\n\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 141] It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\\n\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\\n\\n“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head through the\\n\\nbranches.\\n\\n“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”\\n\\n“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.”\\n\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n\\n“WEASLEY!”\\n\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.\\n\\n“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his family.”'], ['[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 123] “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\n\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months.

Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\n\\n“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”\\n\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\n\\n“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”\\n\\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\", '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.”\\n\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”', \"[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 24] closer look.\\n\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\nLETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\nT he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\", '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 121] “I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\\n\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\\n\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\n\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 110] “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.”\\n\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. “Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\\n\\n“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall\\n\\nexplained.\\n\\n“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light —speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”\\n\\n“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first- year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.…” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n\\n“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.”\\n\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\n\\n“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”\\n\\n“You’re joking.”\\n\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 157] Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\n\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\n\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.', \"[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 130] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\\n\\nQUIDDITCH\\n\\nA s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\\n\\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.\\n\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn’t know which was worse — people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\\n\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\", '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 133] Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours – but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget.\\n\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\\n\\n“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”\\n\\n“I don’t want anything.”\\n\\n“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione.\\n\\n“I’m not hungry.”\\n\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.\\n\\n“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.”\\n\\n“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\\n\\nsausages.\\n\\nBy eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\\n\\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 131] Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.\\n\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately,\\n\\nsomething about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.\\n\\n“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\n\\ncoming….”\\n\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”\\n\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”\\n\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but….', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 110] “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about —”\\n\\n“ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n\\n“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.”\\n\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.\\n\\n“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.”\\n\\n“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”\\n\\n“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.”\\n\\n“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.”\\n\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\n“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 138] “Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.\\n\\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape’s robes.\\n\\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened.\\n\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.\\n\\n“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.\\n\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell into his hand.\\n\\n“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.\\n\\n“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and Hermione.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 163] “You know perfectly well what I mean.”\\n\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”\\n\\n“B-but I d-d-don’t —”\\n\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”\\n\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\\n\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.\\n\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! I’ve waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.”\\n\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this....”\\n\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.\\n\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 147] Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.\\n\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge.\\n\\nIt had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\\n\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\\n\\nHis father’s…this had been his father’s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\\n\\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 44] “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”\\n\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n\\n“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\n\\nangry?”\\n\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it…every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry…chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach…dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\n\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.\\n\\n“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be\\n\\nright famous at Hogwarts.”\\n\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.\\n\\n“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”\\n\\n“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 178] All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\n\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 98] Dear Harry,\\n\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\\n\\nI want to hear all about your first week.

Anyone would want it.”\\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 138] “It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him.

His face wasn’t twitching at all.\\n\\n“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here,\\n\\nPotter.”\\n\\n“But I thought — Snape —”\\n\\n“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”\\n\\nHarry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t.\\n\\n“But Snape tried to kill me!”\\n\\n“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.”\\n\\n“Snape was trying to save me?”\\n\\n“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really…he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular…and what a waste of time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”\", '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 101] was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\\n\\n“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?”\\n\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\n\\n“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n\\n“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”\\n\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\\n\\n“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.”\\n\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much?\\n\\n“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 162] Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\\n\\nThe trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\\n\\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\\n\\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\\n\\n“…d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus…”\\n\\n“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, after all.”\\n\\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.\\n\\n“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?”\\n\\n“B-b-but Severus, I —”\\n\\n“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking a step toward him.\\n\\n“I-I don’t know what you—”', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 132] Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape\\n\\nbandages.\\n\\n“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?”\\n\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but —\\n\\n“POTTER!”\\n\\nSnape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n\\n“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”\\n\\n“GET OUT! OUT!”\\n\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\\n\\n“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the matter?” In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.\\n\\n“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!”\\n\\nHermione’s eyes were wide.\\n\\n“No — he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”\\n\\n“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.”\\n\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] “Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Percy.\\n\\n“N-nothing.”\\n\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.\\n\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.\\n\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”\\n\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n\\n“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”\\n\\nDumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\\n\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 215] Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the invisibility cloak — do you know who sent it to me?”\\n\\n“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things…your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.”\\n\\n“And there’s something else…”\\n\\n“Fire away.”\\n\\n“Quirrell said Snape —”\\n\\n“Professor Snape, Harry.”\\n\\n“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that\\n\\ntrue?”\\n\\n“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“He saved his life.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yes…” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt…I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace.…”\\n\\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. “And sir, there’s one more thing…”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 157] Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\n\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\n\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 178] All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\n\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 161] George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n\\n“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the team, Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”\\n\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n\\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered.\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”\\n\\n“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, and that’s saying something.”\\n\\nRon’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.\\n\\n“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word—”\\n\\n“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry —”\\n\\n“What? Where?”\\n\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 194] sunshine.”\\n\\nBut they didn’t.\\n\\n“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.”\\n\\n“But what can we —”\\n\\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\\n\\nSnape was standing there.\\n\\n“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.\\n\\nThey stared at him.\\n\\n“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted\\n\\nsmile.\\n\\n“We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\\n\\n“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?”\\n\\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\\n\\n“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”\\n\\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\n\\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n\\n“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 209] “Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side….”\\n\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. “I see the Stone…I’m presenting it to my master…but where is it?”\\n\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\\n\\n“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”\\n\\n“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.”\\n\\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was threatening you.…”\\n\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.\\n\\n“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —”\\n\\n“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.\\n\\n“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it…Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me…decided he would have to keep a closer watch on', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 194] “Why me?”\\n\\n“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong….’”\\n\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.\\n\\n“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.”\\n\\nBut that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\n\\n“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come\\n\\nanywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!”\\n\\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] Harry’s heart did a somersault.\\n\\n“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\\n\\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\\n\\nwatching.\\n\\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\\n\\n“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione. “Look — they’re off. Ouch!”\\n\\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\\n\\n“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”\\n\\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\n“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?”\\n\\nRon didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 102] Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.”\\n\\n“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.”\\n\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n\\n“But he seemed to really hate me.”\\n\\n“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”\\n\\nYet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\\n\\n“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with animals.”\\n\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\\n\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 59] setting fire to his bed.”\\n\\n“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly.\\n\\n“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?”\\n\\n“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.\\n\\n“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?”\\n\\n“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”\\n\\n“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”\\n\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n\\n“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.\\n\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\\n“What’s up?” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 177] From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”\\n\\nOnly Ron stood by him.\\n\\n“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.”\\n\\n“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.\\n\\n“Well — no,” Ron admitted.\\n\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n\\n“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”\\n\\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him “the Seeker.”'], ['[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 61] toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”\\n\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\\n\\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\n\\nA magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 185] “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\n\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\\n\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\\n\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\\n\\n“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\\n\\nto come in the movements of the planets?”\\n\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\\n\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n\\n“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!”\\n\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\\n\\n“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.”', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 116] Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.\\n\\nThey weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.\\n\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\n\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\\n\\nHarry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch.\\n\\nThey fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 54] The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n\\n“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”\\n\\nHe grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.\\n\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n\\n“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.”\\n\\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.…”\\n\\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand —', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 204] “Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\\n\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\n\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\\n\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\n\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 93] A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\n\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”\\n\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. “Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!” He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked\\n\\nPercy.\\n\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\\n\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”\\n\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\\n\\n“Password?” she said.\\n\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\\n\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 116] “Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n\\n“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\\n\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.\\n\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in\\n\\na school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”\\n\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on.\\n\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.”\\n\\n“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something.”\\n\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\n\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”\\n\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\\n\\n“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you.\\n\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something…What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 69] It didn’t come…he kept on running…he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts’ Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\\n\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\\n\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”\\n\\n“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.\\n\\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\\n\\n“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”\\n\\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\n\\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 200] “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\\n\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\\n\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\\n\\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\\n\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\\n\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”\\n\\n“I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\\n\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\\n\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 56] “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”\\n\\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.\\n\\n“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.\\n\\n“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”\\n\\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.\\n\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.\\n\\nHarry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 203] Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\n\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\\n\\nand up the next passageway.\\n\\n“What if he’s —?”\\n\\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?”\\n\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\\n\\nThey had reached another door.\\n\\n“All right?” Harry whispered.\\n\\n“Go on.”\\n\\nHarry pushed it open.\\n\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n\\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\\n\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 213] “They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,\\n\\nthey will die.”\\n\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.\\n\\n“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”\\n\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.\\n\\n“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\\n\\n“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”\\n\\n“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 97] “Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”\\n\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\n\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.', \"[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 95] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\n\\nT here, look.”\\n\\n“Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see his face?” “Did you see his scar?”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Did you see his face?”\\n\\n“Did you see his scar?”\\n\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\n\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\", '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 55] fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.…\\n\\n“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.\\n\\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was —\\n\\n“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\\n\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\\n\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.\\n\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\\n\\n“Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 181] “Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”\\n\\n“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\n\\n“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.”\\n\\n“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.\\n\\n“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”\\n\\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 198] “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t!”\\n\\n“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.\\n\\n“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just\\n\\nhave to drop.”\\n\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.\\n\\n“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”\\n\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\\n\\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\\n\\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 198] “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”\\n\\nAnd he scooted off.\\n\\n“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.\\n\\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar.\\n\\n“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.”\\n\\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\n\\n“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”\\n\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.\\n\\n“We’re coming,” said Hermione.\\n\\nHarry pushed the door open.\\n\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them. “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.\\n\\n“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”\\n\\n“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here\\n\\ngoes ….”\\n\\nHe put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 186] Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\\n\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die.

Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\n\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 201] side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\n\\n“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.\\n\\n“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once…well, there’s no other choice…I’ll run.”\\n\\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\\n\\nThe other two followed him.

Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\\n\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\\n\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy.

It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\\n\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty- fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\\n\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone!

Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 204] “Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\\n\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\n\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\\n\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\n\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 195] The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\\n\\n“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone\\n\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“You’re mad!” said Ron.\\n\\n“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!”\\n\\n“SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”\\n\\nHe glared at them.\\n\\n“You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.\\n\\n“I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 93] A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\n\\n“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”\\n\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. “Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!” He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n\\n“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked\\n\\nPercy.\\n\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\\n\\n“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”\\n\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\\n\\n“Password?” she said.\\n\\n“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\\n\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 100] “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\n\\nHe ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a\\n\\nbezoar?”\\n\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\n\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\n\\nceiling.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?”\\n\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 159] “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 186] And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\n\\nHarry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\\n\\n“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?”\\n\\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\n\\n“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”\\n\\n“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.”\\n\\n“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 215] “Just the one?”\\n\\n“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”\\n\\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\\n\\nbrain surprises even me sometimes…Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?”\\n\\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\\n\\n“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.\\n\\n“Absolutely not.”\\n\\n“You let Professor Dumbledore in….”\\n\\n“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.”\\n\\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\n\\nPomfrey…”\\n\\n“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”\\n\\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 205] Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\\n\\n“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”\\n\\n“But so will we, won’t we?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”\\n\\n“But how do we know which to drink?”\\n\\n“Give me a minute.”\\n\\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\\n\\n“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone.”\\n\\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\\n\\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one\\n\\nswallow.”\\n\\nThey looked at each other.\\n\\n“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”\\n\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\\n\\n“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, really.”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 187] “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious… he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 142] “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\\n\\n“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”\\n\\n“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”\\n\\n“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”\\n\\n“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.”\\n\\n“I’m sayin’ nothin’, said Hagrid flatly.\\n\\n“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 203] “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”\\n\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\\n\\n“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me\\n\\nthink…”\\n\\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\n\\n“Yes…” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way…I’ve got to be taken.”\\n\\n“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n\\n“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”\\n\\n“But —”\\n\\n“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\\n\\n“Ron —”\\n\\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”\\n\\nThere was no alternative.\\n\\n“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.”\\n\\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 152] “Do you think this mirror shows the future?”\\n\\n“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —”\\n\\n“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.”\\n\\n“You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.”\\n\\n“Don’t push me —”\\n\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\n\\n“Quick!”\\n\\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and\\n\\nleft.\\n\\n“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.”\\n\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\n\\nThe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.\\n\\n“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”\\n\\n“No…you go…”\\n\\n“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t go back\\n\\ntonight.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.

People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\n\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\", '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 153] “I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”\\n\\n“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”\\n\\n“It — well — it shows me my family —”\\n\\n“And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”\\n\\n“How did you know —?”\\n\\n“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”\\n\\nHarry shook his head.\\n\\n“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”\\n\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want… whatever we want…”\\n\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.

They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\\n\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.\\n\\n“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in\\n\\na school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”\\n\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on.\\n\\n“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.”\\n\\n“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something.”\\n\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\n\\n“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled.

This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.

They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now.

Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\\n\\n“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Or both,” said Harry.\\n\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\\n\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\\n\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.

I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 169] He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.\\n\\n“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\\n\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\\n\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\\n\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.\\n\\n“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?”\\n\\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what\\n\\nHagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”\\n\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered.\\n\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\\n\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 163] “You know perfectly well what I mean.”\\n\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”\\n\\n“B-but I d-d-don’t —”\\n\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”\\n\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\\n\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.\\n\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! I’ve waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.”\\n\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this....”\\n\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.\\n\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break', \"[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 175] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\\n\\nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST\\n\\nT hings couldn’t have been worse.\\n\\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\\n\\nHad Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\\n\\n“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag—”\\n\\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.\", '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 203] Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\n\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\\n\\nand up the next passageway.\\n\\n“What if he’s —?”\\n\\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?”\\n\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\\n\\nThey had reached another door.\\n\\n“All right?” Harry whispered.\\n\\n“Go on.”\\n\\nHarry pushed it open.\\n\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n\\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\\n\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 192] “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\\n\\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore\\n\\nbelieves us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?”\\n\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\\n\\n“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\\n\\n“What are you three doing inside?”\\n\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n\\n“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\\n\\n“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”\\n\\nHarry swallowed — now what?\\n\\n“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 187] “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious… he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 123] “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”\\n\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because\\n\\nNeville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 200] “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\\n\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\\n\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\\n\\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\\n\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\\n\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”\\n\\n“I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\\n\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\\n\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 198] “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. “I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”\\n\\n“No, I don’t!”\\n\\n“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.\\n\\n“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just\\n\\nhave to drop.”\\n\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.\\n\\n“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”\\n\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.\\n\\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.\\n\\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 78] “What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.\\n\\n“Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed.\\n\\n“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world —” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger\\n\\nthis time.\\n\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n\\n“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\\n\\n“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”\\n\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 198] “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”\\n\\nAnd he scooted off.\\n\\n“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.\\n\\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar.\\n\\n“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.”\\n\\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\n\\n“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”\\n\\n“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.\\n\\n“We’re coming,” said Hermione.\\n\\nHarry pushed the door open.\\n\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them. “What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.\\n\\n“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”\\n\\n“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here\\n\\ngoes ….”\\n\\nHe put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.', \"[harry_potter_p0021-0040.pdf | Page 24] closer look.\\n\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\nLETTERS FROM NO ONE\\n\\nT he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\", '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 124] Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\n\\n“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”\\n\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in\\n\\ntears.\\n\\n“I think she heard you.”\\n\\n“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”\\n\\nHermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween\\n\\ndecorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\n\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.\\n\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 173] “Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.\\n\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.\\n\\n“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —”\\n\\n“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got a\\n\\ndragon!”\\n\\n“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!”\\n\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\\n\\n“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”\\n\\n“Don’t,” Harry advised her.\\n\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 194] “Why me?”\\n\\n“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong….’”\\n\\n“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.\\n\\n“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.”\\n\\nBut that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\n\\n“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you’ve come\\n\\nanywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!”\\n\\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”\\n\\n“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.', \"[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 95] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\n\\nT here, look.”\\n\\n“Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see his face?” “Did you see his scar?”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Did you see his face?”\\n\\n“Did you see his scar?”\\n\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\n\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\"], ['[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 203] “Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”\\n\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\\n\\n“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me\\n\\nthink…”\\n\\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\n\\n“Yes…” said Ron softly, “It’s the only way…I’ve got to be taken.”\\n\\n“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n\\n“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”\\n\\n“But —”\\n\\n“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\\n\\n“Ron —”\\n\\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”\\n\\nThere was no alternative.\\n\\n“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.”\\n\\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 202] “Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\\n\\n“This needs thinking about…” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces….”\\n\\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\\n\\n—”\\n\\n“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”\\n\\n“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle.”\\n\\n“What about you?”\\n\\n“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.\\n\\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\\n\\n“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board. “Yes…look…”\\n\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\\n\\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\\n\\n“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”\\n\\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 144] Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.\\n\\n“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”\\n\\n“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”\\n\\n“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione.\\n\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work.\\n\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 187] “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious… he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 111] “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\\n\\n“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s yours?”\\n\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n\\n“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”\\n\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\\n\\n“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re\\n\\nmy second?”\\n\\n“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you\\n\\nknows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 157] Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\n\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\n\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 186] And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\n\\nHarry didn’t have a clue what was going on.\\n\\n“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?”\\n\\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\n\\n“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”\\n\\n“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.”\\n\\n“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 159] “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.”\\n\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 75] Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\n\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\n\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\nC onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\n\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n\\n“He’s gone!”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it? You can start collecting.”\\n\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\\n\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,', '[harry_potter_p0101-0120.pdf | Page 112] “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”\\n\\n“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested.\\n\\n“Excuse me.”\\n\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n\\n“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.\\n\\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n\\n“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying —”\\n\\n“Bet you could,” Ron muttered.\\n\\n“— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.”\\n\\n“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.\\n\\n“Good-bye,” said Ron.\\n\\nAll the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 178] All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\n\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 217] “D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your father’s cloak and everything?”\\n\\n“Well, ” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say that’s terrible — you could have been killed.”\\n\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could….”\\n\\n“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.”\\n\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n\\n“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT” she said firmly.\\n\\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\n\\nI want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can’t I?”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 185] “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\n\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\\n\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\\n\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\\n\\n“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\\n\\nto come in the movements of the planets?”\\n\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\\n\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n\\n“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!”\\n\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\\n\\n“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.”', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 128] let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\n\\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.\\n\\n“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dormitory?”\\n\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\\n\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\\n\\n“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”\\n\\n“Miss Granger!”\\n\\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\n\\n“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”\\n\\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\\n\\nteacher?\\n\\n“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 172] “It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\\n\\n“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.”\\n\\nHarry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\\n\\n“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione. “We haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of\\n\\nNorbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.”\\n\\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\\n\\n“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I can’t handle.”\\n\\nWhen they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\\n\\n“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s only a\\n\\nbaby, after all.”', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 138] “It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.”\\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?”\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.\\n\\n“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.”\\n\\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\\n\\n“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.\\n\\n“Fluffy?”\\n\\n“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —”\\n\\n“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.\\n\\n“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s top secret, that is.”\\n\\n“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”\\n\\n“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of the sort.”\\n\\n“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.\\n\\nThe afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\\n\\nSnape.\\n\\n“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 203] Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\n\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\\n\\nand up the next passageway.\\n\\n“What if he’s —?”\\n\\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?”\\n\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\\n\\nThey had reached another door.\\n\\n“All right?” Harry whispered.\\n\\n“Go on.”\\n\\nHarry pushed it open.\\n\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n\\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\\n\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 136] Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red card!”\\n\\n“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.\\n\\n“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game!”\\n\\n“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.\\n\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.\\n\\n“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.”\\n\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n\\n“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —”\\n\\n“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n“I mean, after that open and revolting foul…”\\n\\n“Jordan, I’m warning you —”\\n\\n“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”\\n\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt anything like that.\\n\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts — he had half a mind', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 172] Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\\n\\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark.\\n\\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nCharlie\\n\\nThey looked at one another.\\n\\n“We’ve got the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It shouldn’t be too difficult – I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.”\\n\\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.\\n\\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous.\\n\\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\\n\\n“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.” Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.'], ['[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 205] “But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”\\n\\n“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.”\\n\\nHermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.\\n\\n“Hermione!”\\n\\n“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”\\n\\n“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!”\\n\\n“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”\\n\\n“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.\\n\\n“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.\\n\\n“No — but it’s like ice.”\\n\\n“Quick, go, before it wears off.”\\n\\n“Good luck — take care.”\\n\\n“GO!”\\n\\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\n\\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.\\n\\n“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\\n\\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting.

Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\\n\\nHagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\\n\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he borrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments… Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”\\n\\n“Snape?”\\n\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\\n\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 205] Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\\n\\n“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”\\n\\n“But so will we, won’t we?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”\\n\\n“But how do we know which to drink?”\\n\\n“Give me a minute.”\\n\\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.\\n\\n“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone.”\\n\\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\\n\\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one\\n\\nswallow.”\\n\\nThey looked at each other.\\n\\n“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”\\n\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\\n\\n“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, really.”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 188] “So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.”\\n\\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n\\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”\\n\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.\\n\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\n\\nJust in case.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 100] “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\n\\nHe ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a\\n\\nbezoar?”\\n\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\n\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\n\\nceiling.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?”\\n\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 195] “All — all three of us?”\\n\\n“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful….”\\n\\n“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”\\n\\n“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.”\\n\\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\\n\\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n\\n“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 216] “Harry!”\\n\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so\\n\\nworried —”\\n\\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really\\n\\nhappened?”\\n\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n\\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to die?”\\n\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”\\n\\n“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n\\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 158] “I knew it! I knew it!”\\n\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”\\n\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\\n\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron.\\n\\n“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”\\n\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\n\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone,\\n\\na legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\\n\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty- fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\\n\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 157] Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.…\\n\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\n\\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, “I need to concen—” He caught sight of Harry’s face.\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”\\n\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\n\\n“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once.\\n\\n“Say you’re ill,” said Ron.\\n\\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“Really break your leg,” said Ron.\\n\\n“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can’t play at all.”\\n\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 158] As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\n\\n“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”\\n\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n“I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”\\n\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited since they’d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\n\\n“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n\\n“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”\\n\\n“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.\\n\\nAt last she found what she was looking for.', \"[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 163] through —”\\n\\n“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.\\n\\n“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.\\n\\nHP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\\n\\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\\n\\nQ uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet.\\n\\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.\\n\\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\\n\\n“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”\\n\\n“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.”\\n\\n“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it’s an A.”\\n\\n“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me.…”\", '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 178] All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\n\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 169] He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t.\\n\\n“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.\\n\\nBut Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.\\n\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\n\\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.\\n\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.\\n\\n“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?”\\n\\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what\\n\\nHagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing—”\\n\\n“Shut up!” Harry whispered.\\n\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all.\\n\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 187] “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious… he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 129] “Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”\\n\\n“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.”\\n\\n“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.\\n\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n\\n“Pig snout,” they said and entered.\\n\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.\\n\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 137] “Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.”\\n\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\n\\n“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced.\\n\\n“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”\\n\\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.\\n\\n“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“What should we do?”\\n\\n“Leave it to me.”\\n\\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good – every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him,\\n\\nobviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.', \"[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 155] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\n\\nNICHOLAS FLAMEL\\n\\nD umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\\n\\n“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\n\\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\n\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\", '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 99] “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.…I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”\\n\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead.\\n\\n“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”\\n\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what?

You have been warned.”\\n\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\n\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 211] The high voice spoke again.\\n\\n“Let me speak to him…face-to-face…”\\n\\n“Master, you are not strong enough!”\\n\\n“I have strength enough…for this…”\\n\\nHarry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\\n\\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\\n\\n“Harry Potter…” it whispered.\\n\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.\\n\\n“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor….I have form only when I can share another’s body…but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds…Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks…you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own….Now…why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket?”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 163] “You know perfectly well what I mean.”\\n\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”\\n\\n“B-but I d-d-don’t —”\\n\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”\\n\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\\n\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.\\n\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! I’ve waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.”\\n\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this....”\\n\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.\\n\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 208] Quirrell snapped his fingers.

I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\\n\\n“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”\\n\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\\n\\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.', \"[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 189] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\\n\\nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR\\n\\nI n years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\\n\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell.\\n\\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\\n\\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\", \"[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 95] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\nTHE POTIONS MASTER\\n\\nT here, look.”\\n\\n“Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see his face?” “Did you see his scar?”\\n\\n“Where?”\\n\\n“Did you see his face?”\\n\\n“Did you see his scar?”\\n\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\\n\\nThe ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”\", '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 53] But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.\\n\\n“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”\\n\\nDoris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\\n\\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\\n\\n“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”\\n\\n“Is he always that nervous?”\\n\\n“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?”\\n\\nVampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n\\n“Three up…two across…” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.” He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 213] “Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.”\\n\\n“But sir, the Stone —”\\n\\n“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.”\\n\\n“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?”\\n\\n“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.”\\n\\n“It was you.”\\n\\n“I feared I might be too late.”\\n\\n“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer –”\\n\\n“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.”\\n\\n“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas Flamel —”\\n\\n“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.”\\n\\n“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 209] “Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side….”\\n\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. “I see the Stone…I’m presenting it to my master…but where is it?”\\n\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\\n\\n“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”\\n\\n“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.”\\n\\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape was threatening you.…”\\n\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face.\\n\\n“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —”\\n\\n“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry gasped.\\n\\n“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it…Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me…decided he would have to keep a closer watch on', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 84] Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet —what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\\n\\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed.\\n\\n“What the —?”\\n\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 100] “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\n\\nHe ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a\\n\\nbezoar?”\\n\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\n\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\n\\nceiling.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?”\\n\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 210] me.…”\\n\\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\\n\\n“I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?” Harry’s mind was racing.\\n\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?\\n\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\n\\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\\n\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\\n\\n“Use the boy…Use the boy.…”\\n\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\\n\\n“Yes — Potter — come here.”\\n\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\\n\\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 200] “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\\n\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\\n\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\\n\\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\\n\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\\n\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”\\n\\n“I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\\n\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\\n\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 186] Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\\n\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\\n\\nknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\\n\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t understand who —”\\n\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\\n\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\n\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\n\\ncoming….”\\n\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”\\n\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”\\n\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but….', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”\\n\\nOn Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).\\n\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] “Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Percy.\\n\\n“N-nothing.”\\n\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.\\n\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.\\n\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”\\n\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n\\n“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”\\n\\nDumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\\n\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 168] “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\\n\\nHagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\\n\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he borrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments… Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”\\n\\n“Snape?”\\n\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\\n\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.'], ['[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 153] “I didn’t know it was called that, Sir.”\\n\\n“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”\\n\\n“It — well — it shows me my family —”\\n\\n“And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.”\\n\\n“How did you know —?”\\n\\n“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?”\\n\\nHarry shook his head.\\n\\n“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”\\n\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want… whatever we want…”\\n\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n\\n“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again.

After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”\\n\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.\\n\\n“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\\n\\n“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”\\n\\n“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 208] Quirrell snapped his fingers.

A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”\\n\\n“But so will we, won’t we?”\\n\\n“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this paper.

Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.\\n\\n“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\n\\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\n\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.\", '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 187] “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious… he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 152] “Do you think this mirror shows the future?”\\n\\n“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —”\\n\\n“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.”\\n\\n“You’re only holding the Quidditch cup, what’s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.”\\n\\n“Don’t push me —”\\n\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\n\\n“Quick!”\\n\\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and\\n\\nleft.\\n\\n“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.”\\n\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\n\\nThe snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.\\n\\n“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”\\n\\n“No…you go…”\\n\\n“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t go back\\n\\ntonight.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 203] Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\n\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\\n\\nand up the next passageway.\\n\\n“What if he’s —?”\\n\\n“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?”\\n\\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s.”\\n\\nThey had reached another door.\\n\\n“All right?” Harry whispered.\\n\\n“Go on.”\\n\\nHarry pushed it open.\\n\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n\\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”\\n\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 185] “My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\n\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.\\n\\n“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”\\n\\n“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”\\n\\n“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\\n\\nto come in the movements of the planets?”\\n\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, “ he said in his gloomy voice.\\n\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n\\n“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!”\\n\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.\\n\\n“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 200] “Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n\\n“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”\\n\\n“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.\\n\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough….\\n\\n“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.\\n\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.\\n\\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?”\\n\\n“I don’t know…sounds like wings to me.”\\n\\n“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”\\n\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 204] “Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\\n\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\n\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\\n\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\n\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 61] toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”\\n\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\\n\\n“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.”\\n\\nA magic wand…this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\n\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 158] “I knew it! I knew it!”\\n\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”\\n\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\\n\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron.\\n\\n“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”\\n\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\n\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone,\\n\\na legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\\n\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty- fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\\n\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 152] “You sound like Hermione.”\\n\\n“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”\\n\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him.\\n\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet\\n\\nanyone.\\n\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\\n\\nExcept —\\n\\n“So — back again, Harry?”\\n\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him.\\n\\n“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”\\n\\n“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\n\\n“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror\\n\\nof Erised.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 142] “Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\\n\\n“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”\\n\\n“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”\\n\\n“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”\\n\\n“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.”\\n\\n“I’m sayin’ nothin’, said Hagrid flatly.\\n\\n“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 149] It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket – but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\\n\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\\n\\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\\n\\nwhirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.\\n\\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.\\n\\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror’s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 202] Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\\n\\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.\\n\\n“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.\\n\\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.\\n\\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no faces.\\n\\n“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.\\n\\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the\\n\\nroom.”\\n\\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n\\n“How?” said Hermione nervously.\\n\\n“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”\\n\\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight’s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 97] “Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”\\n\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\n\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 215] “Just the one?”\\n\\n“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”\\n\\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\\n\\nbrain surprises even me sometimes…Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?”\\n\\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\\n\\n“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.\\n\\n“Absolutely not.”\\n\\n“You let Professor Dumbledore in….”\\n\\n“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.”\\n\\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\n\\nPomfrey…”\\n\\n“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”\\n\\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.'], ['[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 186] Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\\n\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\\n\\nknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\\n\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t understand who —”\\n\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\\n\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\n\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 100] “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”\\n\\nHe ignored Hermione’s hand.\\n\\n“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a\\n\\nbezoar?”\\n\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\\n\\n“I don’t know, sir.”\\n\\n“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\n\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.\\n\\n“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”\\n\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\n\\nceiling.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?”\\n\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n\\n“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 211] The high voice spoke again.\\n\\n“Let me speak to him…face-to-face…”\\n\\n“Master, you are not strong enough!”\\n\\n“I have strength enough…for this…”\\n\\nHarry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\\n\\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\\n\\n“Harry Potter…” it whispered.\\n\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.\\n\\n“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor….I have form only when I can share another’s body…but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds…Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks…you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest…and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own….Now…why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket?”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 178] All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\n\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\n\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 212] “Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!”\\n\\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n\\n“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.\\n\\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face —\\n\\n“AAAARGH!”\\n\\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\\n\\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”\\n\\nHe felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down…down… down….\\n\\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 163] “You know perfectly well what I mean.”\\n\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”\\n\\n“B-but I d-d-don’t —”\\n\\n“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”\\n\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.\\n\\n“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.\\n\\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! I’ve waiting for you in the common room, we’re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.”\\n\\n“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this....”\\n\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard.\\n\\n“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 191] Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\\n“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”\\n\\n“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.\\n\\n“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning…it means danger’s\\n\\ncoming….”\\n\\nRon couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\\n“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”\\n\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”\\n\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy…never…but….', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 210] me.…”\\n\\nQuirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\\n\\n“I don’t understand…is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?” Harry’s mind was racing.\\n\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?\\n\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\n\\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\\n\\nAnd to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.\\n\\n“Use the boy…Use the boy.…”\\n\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\\n\\n“Yes — Potter — come here.”\\n\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.\\n\\n“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 159] “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 158] “I knew it! I knew it!”\\n\\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”\\n\\nThis didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.\\n\\n“The what?” said Harry and Ron.\\n\\n“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look – read that, there.”\\n\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\n\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone,\\n\\na legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\\n\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty- fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).\\n\\n“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 61] “Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.\\n\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.\\n\\n“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.\\n\\n“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n\\n“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n\\n“And that’s where…”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger.\\n\\n“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen- and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands…well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.', '[harry_potter_p0041-0060.pdf | Page 53] “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”\\n\\n“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”\\n\\n“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”\\n\\n“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus\\n\\nDiggle.”\\n\\n“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”\\n\\n“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\n\\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.\\n\\n“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”\\n\\n“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c- can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”\\n\\n“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\\n\\n“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 187] “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious… he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 212] He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.\\n\\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.\\n\\n“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore.\\n\\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”\\n\\n“Then who does? Sir, I —”\\n\\n“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”\\n\\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\\n\\n“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”\\n\\n“How long have I been in here?”', '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 12] Dumbledore nodded glumly.\\n\\n“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done… all the people he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding…of all the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”\\n\\n“We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”\\n\\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 210] you see.”\\n\\nHarry walked toward him.\\n\\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that’s all.\\n\\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\\n\\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — he’d gotten the Stone.\\n\\n“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”\\n\\nHarry screwed up his courage.\\n\\n“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. “I — I’ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.”\\n\\nQuirrell cursed again.\\n\\n“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\\n\\nBut he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.\\n\\n“He lies…He lies.…”\\n\\n“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! What did you just see?”', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 63] Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well…how curious…how very curious…”\\n\\nHe put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious…curious…\\n\\n“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”\\n\\nMr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n\\n“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.”\\n\\nHarry swallowed.\\n\\n“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember…I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter….After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.”\\n\\nHarry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 195] The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\\n\\n“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone\\n\\nfirst.”\\n\\n“You’re mad!” said Ron.\\n\\n“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You’ll be expelled!”\\n\\n“SO WHAT” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”\\n\\nHe glared at them.\\n\\n“You’re right Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.\\n\\n“I’ll use the invisibility cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.” “But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.', '[harry_potter_p0061-0080.pdf | Page 75] Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\n“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.\\n\\n“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”\\n\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\n\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\nC onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\n\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.\\n\\n“He’s gone!”\\n\\n“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her…do you want it? You can start collecting.”\\n\\nRon’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.\\n\\n“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 208] Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\\n\\n“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.”\\n\\n“You let the troll in?”\\n\\n“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else\\n\\nwas running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off properly.\\n\\n“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\\n\\n“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this…but he’s in London…I’ll be far away by the time he gets back…”\\n\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.\\n\\n“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.'], ['[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 168] “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”\\n\\nHagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.\\n\\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that…let’s see…he borrowed Fluffy from me…then some o’ the teachers did enchantments… Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”\\n\\n“Snape?”\\n\\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”\\n\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 188] “So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.”\\n\\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n\\n“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”\\n\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.\\n\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them.

When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the invisibility cloak — do you know who sent it to me?”\\n\\n“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things…your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.”\\n\\n“And there’s something else…”\\n\\n“Fire away.”\\n\\n“Quirrell said Snape —”\\n\\n“Professor Snape, Harry.”\\n\\n“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father.

And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.” “What?”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“He saved his life.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yes…” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt…I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even.

Harry told them what he’d heard.\\n\\n“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”\\n\\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.\\n\\n“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”\\n\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\n“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”\\n\\n“But we’ve got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”', '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 11] “It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”\\n\\n“A what?”\\n\\n“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”\\n\\n“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who\\n\\nhas gone —”\\n\\n“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know- Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”\\n\\n“I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”\\n\\n“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.”\\n\\n“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”\\n\\n“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 216] “Harry!”\\n\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n\\n“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so\\n\\nworried —”\\n\\n“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really\\n\\nhappened?”\\n\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\n\\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to die?”\\n\\n“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’”\\n\\n“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n\\n“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 186] Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.\\n\\n“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”\\n\\n“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\\n\\nknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”\\n\\n“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t understand who —”\\n\\n“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”\\n\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\\n\\n“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol-”\\n\\n“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”\\n\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.\\n\\n“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”', '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 11] Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they’re saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?”\\n\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\n\\n“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”\\n\\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n\\n“Lily and James…I can’t believe it…I didn’t want to believe it…Oh,\\n\\nAlbus…”\\n\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know…I know…” he said heavily.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 160] see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\\n\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\n“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”\\n\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\n“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.”\\n\\n“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 91] “Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Percy.\\n\\n“N-nothing.”\\n\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.\\n\\n“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.\\n\\n“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”\\n\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n\\n“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n\\n“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”\\n\\nDumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\\n\\n“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.', '[harry_potter_p0001-0020.pdf | Page 12] Dumbledore nodded glumly.\\n\\n“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done… all the people he’s killed…he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding…of all the things to stop him…but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”\\n\\n“We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”\\n\\n“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 193] “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.”\\n\\n“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”\\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time – ”\\n\\n“But this is important.”\\n\\n“Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of\\n\\nMagic, Potter?”\\n\\n“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone —”\\n\\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.\\n\\n“How do you know —?” she spluttered.\\n\\n“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”\\n\\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\\n\\n“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.”\\n\\n“But Professor —”\\n\\n“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 192] “I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.\\n\\n“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore\\n\\nbelieves us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?”\\n\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\\n\\n“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.\\n\\n“What are you three doing inside?”\\n\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n\\n“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.\\n\\n“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”\\n\\nHarry swallowed — now what?\\n\\n“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 132] Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape\\n\\nbandages.\\n\\n“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?”\\n\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but —\\n\\n“POTTER!”\\n\\nSnape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n\\n“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”\\n\\n“GET OUT! OUT!”\\n\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\\n\\n“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the matter?” In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen.\\n\\n“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he was going when we saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!”\\n\\nHermione’s eyes were wide.\\n\\n“No — he wouldn’t, she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”\\n\\n“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?”', '[harry_potter_p0181-0200.pdf | Page 187] “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”\\n\\nHarry slid off his back.\\n\\n“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\\n\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.\\n\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\n\\nHarry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.\\n\\n“Snape wants the stone for Voldemort…and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest…and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich….”\\n\\n“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\nHarry wasn’t listening.\\n\\n“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so.…Bane was furious… he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen….They must show that Voldemort’s coming back.…Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.…I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” “Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 214] Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me… things I want to know the truth about.…”\\n\\n“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”\\n\\n“Well…Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?”\\n\\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n\\n“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day…put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older…I know you hate to hear this…when you are ready, you will know.”\\n\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\\n\\n“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”\\n\\n“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign…to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 217] “D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your father’s cloak and everything?”\\n\\n“Well, ” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say that’s terrible — you could have been killed.”\\n\\n“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could….”\\n\\n“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.”\\n\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n\\n“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT” she said firmly.\\n\\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\n\\nI want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can’t I?”'], ['[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 219] “…for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\n\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, “My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall’s giant chess set!”\\n\\nAt last there was silence again.\\n\\n“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger…for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”\\n\\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves — they were a hundred points up.\\n\\n“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. “…for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.”\\n\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\n\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n\\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 83] “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n\\n“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.”\\n\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten\\n\\nhis hair.\\n\\n“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”\\n\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n\\n“How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron.\\n\\n“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\\n\\njoking.”', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 218] Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\\n\\n“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were…you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.…\\n\\n“Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”\\n\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\\n\\nsight.\\n\\n“Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken into account.”\\n\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.\\n\\n“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes…\\n\\n“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”\\n\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 177] “Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.\\n\\n“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.\\n\\n“Professor — please —”\\n\\n“You can’t —”\\n\\n“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”\\n\\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?\\n\\nHarry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?\\n\\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 204] “Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”\\n\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\n\\n“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:\\n\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.

The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”\\n\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want… whatever we want…”\\n\\n“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n\\n“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 219] Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\\n\\n“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.”\\n\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\\n\\nGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape’s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\\n\\nIt was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls…he would never, ever forget tonight.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 156] Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\\n\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\\n\\n“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this time, and he’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!”\\n\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n\\n“Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. “When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be fair if we might\\n\\novertake Slytherin.”\\n\\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n\\n“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”', '[harry_potter_p0161-0180.pdf | Page 177] From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”\\n\\nOnly Ron stood by him.\\n\\n“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.”\\n\\n“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.\\n\\n“Well — no,” Ron admitted.\\n\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n\\n“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”\\n\\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him “the Seeker.”', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 159] “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”\\n\\n“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”\\n\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\n“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show them…it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”\\n\\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione.\\n\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\nHarry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 123] “This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\\n\\n“Well, that’s it any questions?”\\n\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\\n\\n“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of these.”\\n\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\n\\nHarry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 136] Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red card!”\\n\\n“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.\\n\\n“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game!”\\n\\n“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.\\n\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean’s side.\\n\\n“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.”\\n\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n\\n“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —”\\n\\n“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n“I mean, after that open and revolting foul…”\\n\\n“Jordan, I’m warning you —”\\n\\n“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”\\n\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He’d never felt anything like that.\\n\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts — he had half a mind', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 121] “I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.\\n\\n“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”\\n\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n\\n“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.\\n\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\n\\nAs seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 213] “They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,\\n\\nthey will die.”\\n\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.\\n\\n“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.”\\n\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.\\n\\n“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking…sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”\\n\\n“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”\\n\\n“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share…not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.”', '[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 92] “Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\\n\\n“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very\\n\\npainful death.”\\n\\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n\\n“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.\\n\\n“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”\\n\\n“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather\\n\\nfixed.\\n\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n\\n“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed:\\n\\n“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we’ve forgot, just do your best, we’ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.”', '[harry_potter_p0121-0140.pdf | Page 134] colors.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).\\n\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\n\\n“Okay, men,” he said.\\n\\n“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n\\n“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”\\n\\n“The big one,” said Fred Weasley.\\n\\n“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.\\n\\n“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were on the team last year.”\\n\\n“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.”\\n\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”\\n\\n“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”\\n\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\n\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n\\n“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.', '[harry_potter_p0141-0160.pdf | Page 141] CHAPTER TWELVE\\n\\nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED\\n\\nC hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\\n\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\n\\n“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.”\\n\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide- mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.', '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 218] I’ve got loads.…”\\n\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”\\n\\n“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.\\n\\n“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ‘course, he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this.…”\\n\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.\\n\\n“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos… knew yeh didn’ have any…d’yeh like it?”\\n\\nHarry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\n\\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin’s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\\n\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.', \"[harry_potter_p0081-0100.pdf | Page 82] HP 1 - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN\\n\\nTHE SORTING HAT\\n\\nT he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\\n\\n“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.\\n\\n“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”\\n\\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\\n\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\\n\\n“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\", '[harry_potter_p0201-0220.pdf | Page 220] Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life.\\n\\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross Station.\\n\\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.']]\n"

Variation is added by random initial conditions for T block and end-effector. The task requires exploiting complex and contact-rich object dynamics to push the T block precisely, using point contacts.

The demonstration data is generated by a scripted oracle with access to groundtruth state info. This oracle randomly selects an initial block to push and moves it to a randomly selected square. The remaining block is then pushed into the remaining square.

EVALUATION\\n\\nWe systematically evaluate Diffusion Policy on 12 tasks from 4 benchmarks [12, 15, 29, 42]. This evaluation suite includes both simulated and real environments, single and multiple task benchmarks, fully actuated and under-actuated systems, and rigid and fluid objects. We found Diffusion Policy to consistently outperform the prior state-of-the-art on all of the tested benchmarks, with an average success-rate improvement of 46.9%. In the following sections, we provide an overview of each task, our evaluation methodology on that task, and our key takeaways.', 'Caption: ①\\n Table: \\n|  | Human Demo | IBC | IBC | LSTM-GMM | LSTM-GMM | Diffusion Policy | Diffusion Policy | Diffusion Policy | Diffusion Policy |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | Human Demo | pos | vel | pos | vel | T-E2E | ImgNet | R3M | E2E |\\n| IoU | 0.84 | 0.14 | 0.19 | 0.24 | 0.25 | 0.53 | 0.24 | 0.66 | 0.80 |\\n| Succ % | 1.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.20 | 0.10 | 0.65 | 0.15 | 0.80 | 0.95 |\\n| Duration | 20.3 | 56.3 | 41.6 | 47.3 | 51.7 | 57.5 | 55.8 | 31.7 | 22.9 |', '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 9] Fig. 8: Realworld Push-T Comparisons.

Our ablation study (Fig. 5) shows that selecting position control as the diffusion-policy action space significantly outperformed velocity control. The baseline methods we evaluate, however, work best with velocity control (and this is reflected in the literature where most existing work reports using velocity- control action spaces [29, 42, 60, 13, 28, 27]).\\n\\nThe tradeoff in action horizon. As discussed in Sec IV-C, having an action horizon greater than 1 helps the policy predict consistent actions and compensate for idle portions of the demonstration, but too long a horizon reduces performance due to slow reaction time. Our experiment confirms this trade- off (Fig. 6 left) and found the action horizon of 8 steps to be optimal for most tasks that we tested.\\n\\n1Due to a bug in our evaluation code, only 22 environment initializations are used for robomimic tasks.

Diffusion Policy employs re- ceding horizon position control to predict a sequence of actions into the future. This design helps address the latency gap caused by image processing, policy inference, and network delay. Our ablation study with simulated latency showed Diffusion Policy is able to maintain peak performance with latency up to 4 steps (Fig 6). We also find that velocity control is more affected by latency than position control, likely due to compounding error effects.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy is stable to train. We found that the optimal hyperparameters for Diffusion Policy are mostly con- sistent across tasks. In contrast, IBC [12] is prone to training instability. This property is discussed in Sec IV-D.', '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 8] Result Analysis. Diffusion Policy performed close to hu- man level with 95% success rate and 0.8 v.s. 0.84 average IoU, compared with the 0% and 20% success rate of best- performing IBC and LSTM-GMM variants. Fig 8 qualitatively illustrates the behavior for each method starting from the same initial condition. We observed that poor performance during the transition between stages is the most common failure case for the baseline method due to high multimodality during those sections and an ambiguous decision boundary. LSTM- GMM got stuck near the T block in 8 out of 20 evaluations (3rd row), while IBC prematurely left the T block in 6 out of 20 evaluations (4th row). We did not follow the common practice of removing idle actions from training data due to task requirements, which also contributed to LSTM and IBC’s tendency to overfit on small actions and get stuck in this task. The results are best appreciated with videos in supplemental materials.\\n\\nEnd-to-end v.s. pre-trained vision encoders We tested Diffusion Policy with pre-trained vision encoders (ImageNet [9] and R3M[31]), as seen in Tab. V. Diffusion Policy with R3M achieves an 80% success rate but predicts jittery actions and is more likely to get stuck compared to the end-to-end trained version. Diffusion Policy with ImageNet showed less promising results with abrupt actions and poor performance. We found that end-to-end training is still the most effective way to incorporate visual observation into Diffusion Policy, and our best-performing models were all end-to-end trained.', 'Caption: TABLE VI: Hyperparameters for CNN-based Diffusion Policy Ctrl: position or velocity control To: observation horizon Ta: action horizon\\nTp: action prediction horizon ImgRes: environment observation resolution (Camera views x W x H) CropRes: random crop resolution #D-\\nParams: diffusion network number of parameters in millions #V-Params: vision encoder number of parameters in millions Lr: learining rate\\nWDecay: weight decay D-Iters Train: number of training diffusion iterations D-Iters Eval: number of inference diffusion iterations (enabled\\nby DDIM [45])\\n Table: \\n| H-Param | Ctrl | To | Ta | Tp | ImgRes | CropRes | #D-Params | #V-Params | Lr | WDecay | D-Iters Train | D-Iters Eval |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Lift | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 2x84x84 | 2x76x76 | 256 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| Can | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 2x84x84 | 2x76x76 | 256 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| Square | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 2x84x84 | 2x76x76 | 256 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| Transport | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 4x84x85 | 4x76x76 | 264 | 45 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| ToolHang | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 2x240x240 | 2x216x216 | 256 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| Push-T | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 1x96x96 | 1x84x84 | 256 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| Block Push | Pos | 3 | 1 | 12 | N/A | N/A | 256 | 0 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| Kitchen | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | N/A | N/A | 256 | 0 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 100 |\\n| Real Push-T | Pos | 2 | 6 | 16 | 2x320x240 | 2x288x216 | 67 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 16 |\\n| Real Pour | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 2x320x240 | 2x288x216 | 67 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 16 |\\n| Real Spread | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 2x320x240 | 2x288x216 | 67 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 16 |\\n| Real Mug Flip | Pos | 2 | 8 | 16 | 2x320x240 | 2x288x216 | 67 | 22 | 1e-4 | 1e-6 | 100 | 16 |', '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 7] C. Key Findings\\n\\nDiffusion Policy outperforms alternative methods on all tasks and variants, with both state and vision observations, in our simulation benchmark study (Tabs I, II and IV) with an average improvement of 46.9%. Following paragraphs summarize the key takeaways.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy can express short-horizon multimodal- ity. We define short-horizon action multimodality as multiple ways of achieving the same immediate goal, which is preva- lent in human demonstration data [29]. In Fig 4, we present a case study of this type of short-horizon multimodality in the Push-T task. Diffusion Policy learns to approach the contact point equally likely from left or right, while LSTM-GMM [29] and IBC [12] exhibit bias toward one side and BET [42] cannot commit to one mode.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy can express long-horizon multimodality. Long-horizon multimodality is the completion of different sub-goals in inconsistent order. For example, the order of pushing a particular block in the Block Push task or the order of interacting with 7 possible objects in the Kitchen task are arbitrary. We find that Diffusion Policy copes well with this type of multimodality; it outperforms baselines on both tasks by a large margin: 32% improvement on Block Push’s p2 metric and 213% improvement on Kitchen’s p4 metric.', '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 15] F. Observation Horizon\\n\\nWe found state-based Diffusion Policy to be insensitive to observation horizon, as shown in Fig. 12. However, vision- based Diffusion Policy, in particular the variant with CNN backbone, see performance decrease with increasing observa- tion horizon. In practice, we found an observation horizon of 2 is good for most of the tasks for both state and image observations.\\n\\nG. Performance Improvement Calculation\\n\\nFor each task i (column) reported in Tab. I, Tab. II and Tab. IV (mh results ignored), we find the maximum performance for baseline methods max_baselinei and the maximum per- formance for Diffusion Policy variant (CNN vs Transformer) max_oursi. For each task, the performance improvement is calculated as improvementi = max_oursi−max_baselinei (positive max_baselinei for all tasks). Finally, the average improvement is calculated as avg_improvement = 1 N ∑i N improvementi = 0.46858 ≈ 46.9%.\\n\\npushing or tossing the T block onto the table. Prior to this data collection session, the operator has performed this task for many hours and should be considered proficient at this\\n\\ntask.\\n\\n2) Evaluation: We used a fixed training time of 12 hours for each method, and selected the last checkpoint for each, with the exception of IBC, where the checkpoint with min- imum training set action prediction MSE error due to IBC’s training stability issue. The difficulty of training and check- point selection for IBC is demonstrated in main text Fig. 7.', '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 8] VI. REALWORLD EVALUATION\\n\\nWe evaluated Diffusion Policy in the realworld performance on 4 tasks across 2 hardware setups – with training data from different demonstrators for each setup. On the realworld Push- T task, we perform ablations examining Diffusion Policy on 2 architecture options and 3 visual encoder options; we also benchmarked against 2 baseline methods with both position- control and velocity-control action spaces. On all tasks, Dif- fusion Policy variants with both CNN backbones and end- to-end-trained visual encoders yielded the best performance. More details about the task setup and parameters may be found in supplemental materials.\\n\\nA. Realworld Push-T Task\\n\\nReal-world Push-T is significantly harder than the simulated version due to 3 modifications: 1. The real-world Push-T\\n\\ntask is multi-stage. It requires the robot to 1⃝ push the T block into the target and then 2⃝ move its end-effector into a designated end-zone to avoid occlusion. 2. The policy needs to make fine adjustments to make sure the T is fully in the goal region before heading to the end-zone, creating additional short-term multimodality. 3. The IoU metric is measured at the last step instead of taking the maximum over all steps. We threshold success rate by the minimum achieved IoU metric from the human demonstration dataset. Our UR5-based experiment setup is shown in Fig V. Diffusion Policy predicts robot commands at 10 Hz and these commands then linearly interpolated to 125 Hz for robot execution.', '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 15] H-Param Ctrl To Ta Tp #D-params #V-params #Layers Emb Dim Attn Dropout Lr WDecay D-Iters Train D-Iters Eval Lift Pos 2 8 10 9 22 8 256 0.3 1e-4 1e-3 100 100 Can Pos 2 8 10 9 22 8 256 0.3 1e-4 1e-3 100 100 Square Pos 2 8 10 9 22 8 256 0.3 1e-4 1e-3 100 100 Transport Pos 2 8 10 9 45 8 256 0.3 1e-4 1e-3 100 100 ToolHang Pos 2 8 10 9 22 8 256 0.3 1e-4 1e-3 100 100 Push-T Pos 2 8 16 9 22 8 256 0.01 1e-4 1e-1 100 100 Block Push Vel 3 1 5 9 0 8 256 0.3 1e-4 1e-3 100 100 Kitchen Pos 4 8 16 80 0 8 768 0.1 1e-4 1e-3 100 100 Real Push-T Pos 2 6 16 80 22 8 768 0.3 1e-4 1e-3 100 16\\n\\nTABLE VII: Hyperparameters for Transformer-based Diffusion Policy Ctrl: position or velocity control To: observation horizon Ta: action horizon Tp: action prediction horizon #D-Params: diffusion network number of parameters in millions #V-Params: vision encoder number of parameters in millions Emb Dim: transformer token embedding dimension Attn Dropout: transformer attention dropout probability Lr: learining rate WDecay: weight decay (for transformer only) D-Iters Train: number of training diffusion iterations D-Iters Eval: number of inference diffusion iterations (enabled by DDIM [45])\\n\\nE.

In practice, the inaccuracy of negative sampling is known to cause training instability for EBMs [11, 48].\\n\\nDiffusion Policy and DDPMs sidestep the issue of estimat- ing Z(a,θ) altogether by modeling the score function [46] of the same action distribution in Eq 6:\\n\\nVa log p(alo) = —VaEo(a,0) — ValogZ(o, 0) + —€9(a,o) VY =0\\n\\nwhere the noise-prediction network εθ(a,o) is approximating the negative of the score function ∇alog p(a|o) [26], which is independent of the normalization constant Z(o,θ).

However, vision- based Diffusion Policy, in particular the variant with CNN backbone, see performance decrease with increasing observa- tion horizon. In practice, we found an observation horizon of 2 is good for most of the tasks for both state and image observations.\\n\\nG. Performance Improvement Calculation\\n\\nFor each task i (column) reported in Tab. I, Tab. II and Tab. IV (mh results ignored), we find the maximum performance for baseline methods max_baselinei and the maximum per- formance for Diffusion Policy variant (CNN vs Transformer) max_oursi. For each task, the performance improvement is calculated as improvementi = max_oursi−max_baselinei (positive max_baselinei for all tasks). Finally, the average improvement is calculated as avg_improvement = 1 N ∑i N improvementi = 0.46858 ≈ 46.9%.\\n\\npushing or tossing the T block onto the table.

Diffusion Policy performed close to hu- man level with 95% success rate and 0.8 v.s. 0.84 average IoU, compared with the 0% and 20% success rate of best- performing IBC and LSTM-GMM variants. Fig 8 qualitatively illustrates the behavior for each method starting from the same initial condition. We observed that poor performance during the transition between stages is the most common failure case for the baseline method due to high multimodality during those sections and an ambiguous decision boundary. LSTM- GMM got stuck near the T block in 8 out of 20 evaluations (3rd row), while IBC prematurely left the T block in 6 out of 20 evaluations (4th row). We did not follow the common practice of removing idle actions from training data due to task requirements, which also contributed to LSTM and IBC’s tendency to overfit on small actions and get stuck in this task. The results are best appreciated with videos in supplemental materials.\\n\\nEnd-to-end v.s. pre-trained vision encoders We tested Diffusion Policy with pre-trained vision encoders (ImageNet [9] and R3M[31]), as seen in Tab. V. Diffusion Policy with R3M achieves an 80% success rate but predicts jittery actions and is more likely to get stuck compared to the end-to-end trained version. Diffusion Policy with ImageNet showed less promising results with abrupt actions and poor performance. We found that end-to-end training is still the most effective way to incorporate visual observation into Diffusion Policy, and our best-performing models were all end-to-end trained.',\n",

For PushBlock, px is the frequency of pushing x blocks into the targets. For Kitchen, px is the frequency of interacting with x or more objects (e.g. bottom burner). Diffusion Policy performs better, especially for difficult metrics such as p2 for Block Pushing and p4 for Kitchen, as demonstrated by our results.\\n\\nend-effector (blue)s. Variation is added by random initial conditions for T block and end-effector. The task requires exploiting complex and contact-rich object dynamics to push the T block precisely, using point contacts. There are two variants: one with RGB image observations and another with 9 2D keypoints obtained from the ground-truth pose of the T block, both with proprioception for end-effector location.\\n\\n3) Multimodal Block Pushing: adapted from BET [42], this task tests the policy’s ability to model multimodal action dis- tributions by pushing two blocks into two squares in any order. The demonstration data is generated by a scripted oracle with access to groundtruth state info. This oracle randomly selects an initial block to push and moves it to a randomly selected square. The remaining block is then pushed into the remaining square. This task contains long-horizon multimodality that can not be modeled by a single function mapping from observation to action.',\n",

Key Findings\\n\\nDiffusion Policy outperforms alternative methods on all tasks and variants, with both state and vision observations, in our simulation benchmark study (Tabs I, II and IV) with an average improvement of 46.9%. Following paragraphs summarize the key takeaways.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy can express short-horizon multimodal- ity. We define short-horizon action multimodality as multiple ways of achieving the same immediate goal, which is preva- lent in human demonstration data [29]. In Fig 4, we present a case study of this type of short-horizon multimodality in the Push-T task. Diffusion Policy learns to approach the contact point equally likely from left or right, while LSTM-GMM [29] and IBC [12] exhibit bias toward one side and BET [42] cannot commit to one mode.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy can express long-horizon multimodality. Long-horizon multimodality is the completion of different sub-goals in inconsistent order. For example, the order of pushing a particular block in the Block Push task or the order of interacting with 7 possible objects in the Kitchen task are arbitrary. We find that Diffusion Policy copes well with this type of multimodality; it outperforms baselines on both tasks by a large margin: 32% improvement on Block Push’s p2 metric and 213% improvement on Kitchen’s p4 metric.',\n",

       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 1] Abstract—This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot’s visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We bench- mark Diffusion Policy across 12 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models.

In this formulation, instead of directly outputting an action, the policy infers the action-score gradient, conditioned on visual observations, for K denoising iterations (Fig. 1 c). This formulation allows robot policies to inherit several key properties from diffusion models – significantly improving performance.\\n\\n• Expressing multimodal action distributions.

Network Architecture Options\\n\\nClosed-loop action-sequence prediction: An effective ac- tion formulation should encourage temporal consistency and smoothness in long-horizon planning while allowing prompt reactions to unexpected observations. To accomplish this goal, we integrate the action-sequence prediction produced by a diffusion model with receding horizon control [30] to achieve robust action execution. Concretely, at time step t the policy takes the latest To steps of observation data Ot as input and predicts Tp steps of actions, of which Ta steps of actions are executed on the robot without re-planning. Here, we define To as the observation horizon, Tp as the action prediction horizon and Ta as the action execution horizon. This encourages temporal action consistency while remaining responsive. More details about the effects of Ta are discussed in Sec IV-C.',\n",

Note that the choice of noise prediction network εθ is independent of visual encoders, which will be described in Sec. III-B.\\n\\nCNN-based Diffusion Policy We adopt the 1D temporal CNN from Janner et al. [21] with a few modifications: First, we only model the conditional distribution p(At|Ot) by conditioning the action generation process on observation features Ot with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) [35] as well as denoising iteration k, shown in Fig 3 (b). Second, we only predict the action trajectory instead of the concatenated observation action trajectory. Third, we removed inpainting-based goal state conditioning due to incompatibility with our framework utilizing a receding prediction horizon. However, goal conditioning is still possible with the same FiLM conditioning method used for observations.',\n",

Noise Schedule\\n\\nThe noise schedule, defined by σ, α, γ and the additive Gaussian Noise εk as functions of k, has been actively studied [18, 33]. The underlying noise schedule controls the extent to which diffusion policy captures high and low-frequency characteristics of action signals. In our control tasks, we empirically found that the Square Cosine Schedule proposed in iDDPM [33] works best for our tasks.\\n\\nD. Accelerating Inference for Real-time Control\\n\\nWe use the diffusion process as the policy for robots; hence, it is critical to have a fast inference speed for closed-loop real-time control. The Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) approach [45] decouples the number of denoising iterations in training and inference, thereby allowing the algorithm to use fewer iterations for inference to speed up the process. In our real-world experiments, using DDIM with 100 training iterations and 10 inference iterations enables 0.1s inference latency on an Nvidia 3080 GPU.\\n\\nIV.

       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 4] The challenge of modeling multi-modal distribution in hu- man demonstrations has been widely discussed in behavior cloning literature [12, 42, 29]. Diffusion Policy’s ability to express multimodal distributions naturally and precisely is one of its key advantages.\\n\\nIntuitively, multi-modality in action generation for diffusion policy arises from two sources – an underlying stochastic sampling procedure and a stochastic initialization. In Stochas- tic Langevin Dynamics, an initial sample AK t is drawn from standard Gaussian at the beginning of each sampling process, which helps specify different possible convergence basins for the final action prediction A0 t . This action is then further stochastically optimized, with added Gaussian perturbations across a large number of iterations, which enables individual action samples to converge and move between different multi- modal action basins.

Diffusion Policy learns both modes and commits to only one mode within each rollout. In contrast, both LSTM-GMM [29] and IBC [12] are biased toward one mode, while BET [42] fails to commit to a single mode due to its lack of temporal action consistency.

Synergy with Position Control\\n\\nWe find that Diffusion Policy with a position-control action space consistently outperforms Diffusion Policy with velocity control, as shown in Fig 5. This surprising result stands in contrast to the majority of recent behavior cloning work that generally relies on velocity control [29, 42, 60, 13, 28, 27]. We speculate that there are two primary reasons for this discrepancy: First, action multimodality is more pronounced in position-control mode than it is when using velocity control. Because Diffusion Policy better expresses action multimodal- ity than existing approaches, we speculate that it is inherently less affected by this drawback than existing methods. Further- more, position control suffers less than velocity control from compounding error effects and is thus more suitable for action- sequence prediction (as discussed in the following section). As a result, Diffusion Policy is both less affected by the primary',\n",

       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 5] • Temporal action consistency: Take Fig 4 as an example. To push the T block into the target from the bottom, the policy can go around the T block from either left or right. However, suppose each action in the sequence is predicted as independent multimodal distributions (as done in BC- RNN and BET). In that case, consecutive actions could be drawn from different modes, resulting in jittery actions that alternate between the two valid trajectories.\\n\\n• Robustness to idle actions: Idle actions occur when a demonstration is paused and results in sequences of identical positional actions or near-zero velocity actions. It is common during teleoperation and is sometimes required for tasks like liquid pouring. However, single-step policies can easily overfit to this pausing behavior. For example, BC-RNN and IBC often get stuck in real-world experiments when the idle actions are not explicitly removed from training.\\n\\nD.

As a result, Florence et al. [12] evaluate every checkpoint and report results for the best- performing checkpoint. In a real-world setting, this workflow necessitates the evaluation of many policies on hardware to select a final policy. Here, we discuss why Diffusion Policy appears significantly more stable to train.\\n\\nAn implicit policy represents the action distribution using an Energy-Based Model (EBM):\\n\\npθ(a|o) = e−Eθ(o,a) Z(o,θ) (6)\\n\\nwhere Z(o,θ) is an intractable normalization constant (with respect to a).\\n\\nTo train the EBM for implicit policy, an InfoNCE-style loss function is used, which equates to the negative log-likelihood of Eq 6:',\n",

In practice, the inaccuracy of negative sampling is known to cause training instability for EBMs [11, 48].\\n\\nDiffusion Policy and DDPMs sidestep the issue of estimat- ing Z(a,θ) altogether by modeling the score function [46] of the same action distribution in Eq 6:\\n\\nVa log p(alo) = —VaEo(a,0) — ValogZ(o, 0) + —€9(a,o) VY =0\\n\\nwhere the noise-prediction network εθ(a,o) is approximating the negative of the score function ∇alog p(a|o) [26], which is independent of the normalization constant Z(o,θ).

The demonstration data is generated by a scripted oracle with access to groundtruth state info. This oracle randomly selects an initial block to push and moves it to a randomly selected square. The remaining block is then pushed into the remaining square. This task contains long-horizon multimodality that can not be modeled by a single function mapping from observation to action.',\n",

Evaluation Methodology\\n\\nWe present the best-performing for each baseline method on each benchmark from all possible sources – our reproduced result (LSTM-GMM) or original number reported in the paper (BET, IBC). We report results from the average of the last 10 checkpoints (saved every 50 epochs) across 3 training\\n\\nseeds and 50 environment initializations 1 (an average of 1500 experiments in total). The metric for most tasks is success rate, except for the Push-T task, which uses target area coverage. In addition, we report the average of best-performing checkpoints for robomimic and Push-T tasks to be consistent with the evaluation methodology of their respective original papers [29, 12]. All state-based tasks are trained for 4500 epochs, and image-based tasks for 3000 epochs. Each method is evaluated with its best-performing action space: position control for Diffusion Policy and velocity control for baselines (the effect of action space will be discussed in detail in Sec V-C). The results from these simulation benchmarks are summarized in Table I and Table II.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 7] C. Key Findings\\n\\nDiffusion Policy outperforms alternative methods on all tasks and variants, with both state and vision observations, in our simulation benchmark study (Tabs I, II and IV) with an average improvement of 46.9%. Following paragraphs summarize the key takeaways.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy can express short-horizon multimodal- ity. We define short-horizon action multimodality as multiple ways of achieving the same immediate goal, which is preva- lent in human demonstration data [29]. In Fig 4, we present a case study of this type of short-horizon multimodality in the Push-T task. Diffusion Policy learns to approach the contact point equally likely from left or right, while LSTM-GMM [29] and IBC [12] exhibit bias toward one side and BET [42] cannot commit to one mode.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy can express long-horizon multimodality. Long-horizon multimodality is the completion of different sub-goals in inconsistent order. For example, the order of pushing a particular block in the Block Push task or the order of interacting with 7 possible objects in the Kitchen task are arbitrary. We find that Diffusion Policy copes well with this type of multimodality; it outperforms baselines on both tasks by a large margin: 32% improvement on Block Push’s p2 metric and 213% improvement on Kitchen’s p4 metric.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 7] Diffusion Policy can better leverage position control. Our ablation study (Fig. 5) shows that selecting position control as the diffusion-policy action space significantly outperformed velocity control. The baseline methods we evaluate, however, work best with velocity control (and this is reflected in the literature where most existing work reports using velocity- control action spaces [29, 42, 60, 13, 28, 27]).\\n\\nThe tradeoff in action horizon. As discussed in Sec IV-C, having an action horizon greater than 1 helps the policy predict consistent actions and compensate for idle portions of the demonstration, but too long a horizon reduces performance due to slow reaction time. Our experiment confirms this trade- off (Fig. 6 left) and found the action horizon of 8 steps to be optimal for most tasks that we tested.\\n\\n1Due to a bug in our evaluation code, only 22 environment initializations are used for robomimic tasks. This does not change our conclusion since all baseline methods are evaluated in the same way.\\n\\nHuman IBC LSTM-GMM Demo pos vel pos vel\\n\\na task to goal the We\\n\\nDiffusion Policy\\n\\n|T-E2E ImgNet R3M E2E\\n\\n0.84 |0.14 0.19]0.24 0.25 | 0.53 Succ % | 1.00 |0.00 0.00}0.20 0.10 | 0.65 Duration} 20.3 |56.3 41.6|47.3 51.7 | 57.5',\n",

Diffusion Policy employs re- ceding horizon position control to predict a sequence of actions into the future. This design helps address the latency gap caused by image processing, policy inference, and network delay. Our ablation study with simulated latency showed Diffusion Policy is able to maintain peak performance with latency up to 4 steps (Fig 6). We also find that velocity control is more affected by latency than position control, likely due to compounding error effects.\\n\\nDiffusion Policy is stable to train. We found that the optimal hyperparameters for Diffusion Policy are mostly con- sistent across tasks. In contrast, IBC [12] is prone to training instability. This property is discussed in Sec IV-D.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 8] VI. REALWORLD EVALUATION\\n\\nWe evaluated Diffusion Policy in the realworld performance on 4 tasks across 2 hardware setups – with training data from different demonstrators for each setup. On the realworld Push- T task, we perform ablations examining Diffusion Policy on 2 architecture options and 3 visual encoder options; we also benchmarked against 2 baseline methods with both position- control and velocity-control action spaces. On all tasks, Dif- fusion Policy variants with both CNN backbones and end- to-end-trained visual encoders yielded the best performance. More details about the task setup and parameters may be found in supplemental materials.\\n\\nA. Realworld Push-T Task\\n\\nReal-world Push-T is significantly harder than the simulated version due to 3 modifications: 1. The real-world Push-T\\n\\ntask is multi-stage. It requires the robot to 1⃝ push the T block into the target and then 2⃝ move its end-effector into a designated end-zone to avoid occlusion. 2. The policy needs to make fine adjustments to make sure the T is fully in the goal region before heading to the end-zone, creating additional short-term multimodality. 3. The IoU metric is measured at the last step instead of taking the maximum over all steps. We threshold success rate by the minimum achieved IoU metric from the human demonstration dataset. Our UR5-based experiment setup is shown in Fig V. Diffusion Policy predicts robot commands at 10 Hz and these commands then linearly interpolated to 125 Hz for robot execution.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 8] Result Analysis. Diffusion Policy performed close to hu- man level with 95% success rate and 0.8 v.s. 0.84 average IoU, compared with the 0% and 20% success rate of best- performing IBC and LSTM-GMM variants. Fig 8 qualitatively illustrates the behavior for each method starting from the same initial condition. We observed that poor performance during the transition between stages is the most common failure case for the baseline method due to high multimodality during those sections and an ambiguous decision boundary. LSTM- GMM got stuck near the T block in 8 out of 20 evaluations (3rd row), while IBC prematurely left the T block in 6 out of 20 evaluations (4th row). We did not follow the common practice of removing idle actions from training data due to task requirements, which also contributed to LSTM and IBC’s tendency to overfit on small actions and get stuck in this task. The results are best appreciated with videos in supplemental materials.\\n\\nEnd-to-end v.s. pre-trained vision encoders We tested Diffusion Policy with pre-trained vision encoders (ImageNet [9] and R3M[31]), as seen in Tab. V. Diffusion Policy with R3M achieves an 80% success rate but predicts jittery actions and is more likely to get stuck compared to the end-to-end trained version. Diffusion Policy with ImageNet showed less promising results with abrupt actions and poor performance. We found that end-to-end training is still the most effective way to incorporate visual observation into Diffusion Policy, and our best-performing models were all end-to-end trained.',\n",

As shown in Fig 9, three types of perturbations are applied. 1) The front camera was blocked for 3 secs by a waving hand (left column), but the diffusion policy, despite exhibiting some jitter, remained on-course and pushed the T block into position. 2) We shifted the T block while Diffusion Policy was making fine adjustments to the T block’s position. Diffusion policy immediately re-planned to push from the opposite direction, negating the impact of perturbation. 3) We moved the T block while the robot was en route to the end-zone after the first stage’s completion. The Diffusion Policy immediately changed course to adjust the T block back to its target and then continued to the end-zone.

Our Franka Panda setup and tasks are shown in Fig 11. The goal for the 6DoF pouring task is to pour one full ladle of sauce onto the center of the pizza dough, with performance measured by IoU between the poured sauce mask and a nominal circle at the center of the pizza dough (illustrated by the green circle in Fig 11). The goal for the periodic spreading task is to spread sauce on pizza dough, with performance measured by sauce coverage. Variations across evaluation episodes come from random locations for the dough and the sauce bowl. The success rate is computed by thresholding with minimum human performance. Results are best viewed in supplemental videos. Both tasks were trained with the same Push-T hyperparameters, and successful policies were achieved on the first attempt.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 10] Explicit Policy. The simplest form of explicit policies maps from world state or observation directly to action [36, 60, 13, 41, 50, 37, 6]. They can be supervised with a direct regression loss and have efficient inference time with one forward pass. Unfortunately, this type of policy is not suitable for modeling multi-modal demonstrated behavior, and struggles with high-precision tasks [12]. A popular approach to model multimodal action distributions while maintaining the simplicity of direction action mapping is convert the regression task into classification by discretizing the action space [59, 56, 4]. However, the number of bins needed to ap- proximate a continuous action space grows exponentially with increasing dimensionality. Another approach is to combine Categorical and Gaussian distributions to represent continuous multimodal distributions via the use of MDNs [5, 29] or clustering with offset prediction [42, 43]. Nevertheless, these models tend to be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, exhibit mode collapse, and are still limited in their ability to express high-precision behavior [12].\\n\\nThe sauce pouring task requires the robot to remain sta- tionary for a period of time to fill the ladle with viscous tomato sauce. The resulting idle actions are known to be challenging for behavior cloning algorithms and therefore are often avoided or filtered out. Fine adjustments during pouring are necessary during sauce pouring to ensure coverage and to achieve the desired shape.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 10] Implicit Policy. Implicit policies [12, 22] define distribu- tions over actions by using Energy-Based Models (EBMs) [24, 10, 8, 14, 11]. In this setting, each action is assigned an energy value, with action prediction corresponding to the optimization problem of finding a minimal energy action. Since different actions may be assigned low energies, implicit policies naturally represent multi-modal distributions. How- ever, existing implicit policies [12] are unstable to train due\\n\\nThe demonstrated sauce-spreading strategy is inspired by the human chef technique, which requires both a long-horizon cyclic pattern to maximize coverage and short-horizon feed- back for even distribution (since the tomato sauce used often drips out in lumps with unpredictable sizes).

Diffusion models are probabilistic gen- erative models that iteratively refine randomly sampled noise into draws from an underlying distribution. They can also be conceptually understood as learning the gradient field of an implicit action score and then optimizing that gradient during inference. Diffusion models [44, 18] have recently been applied to solve various different control tasks [20, 51, 1].',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 11] In particular, Janner et al. [20] and Huang et al. [19] explore how diffusion models may be used in the context of planning and infer a trajectory of actions that may be executed in a given environment. In the context of Reinforcement Learning, Wang et al. [53] use diffusion model for policy representation and regularization with state-based observations. In contrast, in this work, we explore how diffusion models may instead be effec- tively applied in the context of behavioral cloning for effective visuomotor control policy. To construct effective visuomotor control policies, we propose to combine DDPM’s ability to predict high-dimensional action squences with closed-loop control, as well as a new transformer architecture for action diffusion and a manner to integrate visual inputs into the action diffusion model.\\n\\nWang et al. [54] explore how diffusion models learned from expert demonstrations can be used to augment classical explicit polices without directly taking advantage of diffusion models as policy representation.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 11] Concurrent to us, Pearce et al. [34], Reuss et al. [39] and Hansen-Estruch et al. [16] has conducted a complimentary analysis of diffusion-based policies in simulated environments. While they focus more on effective sampling strategies, lever- aging classifier-free guidance for goal-conditioning as well as applications in Reinforcement Learning, and we focus on effective action spaces, our empirical findings largely concur in the simulated regime. In addition, our extensive real- world experiments provide strong evidence for the importance of a receding-horizon prediction scheme, the careful choice between velocity and position control, and the necessity of optimization for real-time inference and other critical design decisions for a physical robot system.',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 11] VIII. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\\n\\nAlthough we have demonstrated the effectiveness of diffu- sion policy in both simulation and real-world systems, there are limitations that future work can improve. First, our im- plementation inherits limitations from behavior cloning, such as suboptimal performance with inadequate demonstration data. Diffusion policy can be applied to other paradigms, such as reinforcement learning [54, 16], to take advantage of suboptimal and negative data. Second, diffusion policy has higher computational costs and inference latency compared to simpler methods like LSTM-GMM. Our action sequence prediction approach partially mitigates this issue, but may not suffice for tasks requiring high rate control. Future work can exploit the latest advancements in diffusion model acceleration methods to reduce the number of inference steps required,\\n\\nsuch as new noise schedules[7], inference solvers[23], and consistency models [47].',\n",
       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 11] IX. CONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this work, we assess the feasibility of diffusion-based policies for robot behaviors. Through a comprehensive evalu- ation of 12 tasks in simulation and the real world, we demon- strate that diffusion-based visuomotor policies consistently and definitively outperform existing methods while also being stable and easy to train. Our results also highlight critical design factors, including receding-horizon action prediction, end-effector position control, and efficient visual conditioning, that is crucial for unlocking the full potential of diffusion- based policies. While many factors affect the ultimate quality of behavior-cloned policies — including the quality and quan- tity of demonstrations, the physical capabilities of the robot, the policy architecture, and the pretraining regime used — our experimental results strongly indicate that policy structure poses a significant performance bottleneck during behavior cloning. We hope that this work drives further exploration in the field into diffusion-based policies and highlights the importance of considering all aspects of the behavior cloning process beyond just the data used for policy training.',\n",

Normalization\\n\\nProperly normalizing action data is critical to achieve best performance for Diffusion Policy. Scaling the min and max of each action dimension independently to [−1,1] works well for most tasks. Since DDPMs clip prediction to [−1,1] at each iteration to ensure stability, the common zero-mean unit- variance normalization will cause some region of the action space to be inaccessible. When the data variance is small (e.g., near constant value), shift the data to zero-mean without scal- ing to prevent numerical issues. We leave action dimensions corresponding to rotation representations (e.g. Quaternion) unchanged.\\n\\nB. Rotation Representation\\n\\nFor all environments with velocity control action space, we followed the standard practice [29] to use 3D axis-angle representation for the rotation component of action. Since ve- locity action commands are usually close to 0, the singularity and discontinuity of the axis-angle representation don’t usu- ally cause problems. We used the 6D rotation representation proposed in Zhou et al. [61] for all environments (real-world and simulation) with positional control action space.\\n\\nC. Image Augmentation\\n\\nFollowing Mandlekar et al. [29], we employed random crop augmentation during training. The crop size for each task is indicated in Tab. VI.

       "  '[diffusion_policy_p0001-0016.pdf | Page 14] We found that the optimal hyperparameters for CNN- based Diffusion Policy are consistent across tasks. In contrast, transformer-based Diffusion Policy’s optimal attention dropout rate and weight decay varies greatly across different tasks. During tuning, we found increasing the number of parameters in CNN-based Diffusion Policy always improves performance, therefore the optimal model size is limited by the available compute and memory capacity. On the other hand, increasing model size for transformer-based Diffusion Policy (in particu- lar number of layers) hurts performance sometimes. For CNN- based Diffusion Policy, We found using FiLM conditioning to pass-in observations is better than impainting on all tasks except Push-T. Performance reported for DiffusionPolicy-C on Push-T in Tab. I used impaiting instead of FiLM.\\n\\nOn simulation benchmarks, we used the iDDPM algorithm [33] with the same 100 denoising diffusion iterations for both training and inference. We used DDIM [45] on realworld benchmarks to reduce the inference denoising iterations to 16 therefore reducing inference latency.\\n\\nWe used batch size of 256 for all state-based experiments and 64 for all image-based experiments.

For each task, the performance improvement is calculated as improvementi = max_oursi−max_baselinei (positive max_baselinei for all tasks).

For spreading, location of the pizza dough as well as the poured sauce shape are varied. For resetting, we manually gather sauce towards the center of the dough, and wipe the remaining dough clean.

The interpolation controller limits the end-effector velocity to be below 0.43 m/s and its position to be within the region 1cm above the table for safety reason. Position-controlled policies directly predicts the desired end-effector pose, while velocity- controlled policies predicts the difference the current positional setpoint and the previous setpoint.\\n\\nThe UR5 robot station has 5 realsense D415 depth camera recording 720p RGB videos at 30fps.

Franka robot station\\n\\nExperiments for Sauce Pouring and Spreading tasks are performed on the Franka robot station.\\n\\nA custom mid-level controller is implemented to generate desired joint positions from desired end effector poses from the learned policies. At each time step, we solve a differential kinematics problem (formulated as a Quadratic Program) to compute the desired joint velocity to track the desired end effector velocity. The resulting joint velocity is Euler inte- grated into joint position, which is tracked by a joint level controller on the robot. This formulation allows us to impose constraints such as collision avoidance, safety region for end effector and joint limits. It also enables regulating redundant\\n\\nDoF in the null space of the end effector commands. This mid-level controller is particularly valuable for safeguarding the learned policy during hardware deployment.\\n\\nThe operator uses a SpaceMouse input device to control robot’s end effector, and the gripper is controlled by a trigger button. Tele-op and learned policies run at 10Hz, and the mid- level controller runs around 1kHz. Desired end effector pose commands are interpolated by the mid-level controller.
